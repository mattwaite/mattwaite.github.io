# Lollipop charts

Second to my love of waffle charts because I'm always hungry, lollipop charts are an excellently named way of showing the difference between two things on a number line -- a start and a finish, for instance. Or the difference between two related things. Say, turnovers and assists. They aren't a geom, specifically, but you can assemble them out of points and segments, which are geoms.

```

For the first example, let's look at the difference between a team's shooting performance and the conference's shooting performance as a whole. To get this, we're going to add up all the shots made by the conference, all the attempts taken by the conference, and then mutate a percentage based on that. 


```r
conferenceshooting <- logs %>% group_by(Conference) %>% summarise(totalshots = sum(TeamFG), totalattempts = sum(TeamFGA)) %>% mutate(conferenceshootingpct = totalshots/totalattempts)
```

Now I'm going to do the same with teams. 


```r
teamshooting <- logs %>% group_by(Team, Conference) %>% summarise(totalshots = sum(TeamFG), totalattempts = sum(TeamFGA)) %>% mutate(teamshootingpct = totalshots/totalattempts)
```

The last thing I need to do is join them together. So each team will have the conference shooting percentage as well as their own. 


```r
shooting <- teamshooting %>% left_join(conferenceshooting, by="Conference")
```

I have every team in college basketball, but that's insane. 


```r
big10 <- shooting %>% filter(Conference == "Big Ten")
```

So this takes a little doing, but the logic is pretty clear in the end. 

A lollipop chart is made up of two things -- a line between two points, and two points. So we need a geom_segment and two geom_points. And because they get layered starting at the bottom, our segment is first. A geom segment is made up of two things -- an x and a y value, and an x and y end. In this case, our x and xend are the same -- the Team -- and our y and yend are our two stats. For our points, both x values are the Team and the y is the different stats. What that does is put each point on the same line. 


```r
ggplot(big10) +
  geom_segment(aes(x=Team, xend=Team, y=teamshootingpct, yend=conferenceshootingpct), color="grey") + 
  geom_point(aes(x=Team, y=teamshootingpct), color="red") + 
  geom_point(aes(x=Team, y=conferenceshootingpct), color="blue") +
  coord_flip()
```

We can do better by changing the order of the teams by their shooting performance and giving it some theme love. 


```r
ggplot(big10) +
  geom_segment(aes(x=reorder(Team, teamshootingpct), xend=Team, y=teamshootingpct, yend=conferenceshootingpct), color="grey") + 
  geom_point(aes(x=reorder(Team, teamshootingpct), y=teamshootingpct), color="red") + 
  geom_point(aes(x=reorder(Team, teamshootingpct), y=conferenceshootingpct), color="blue") +
  coord_flip() +
   labs(x="", y="Shooting percentage vs league average", title="Except Purdue, shooting predicted Big Ten success", subtitle="The Boilermakers were average shooters, went deep in the NCAA tournament", caption="Source: sports-reference.com | By Matt Waite") +
  theme_minimal() + 
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = "bold", hjust = 1),
    plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 1.3),
    axis.title = element_text(size = 10),
    axis.title.y = element_blank(),
    axis.text = element_text(size = 7),
    axis.ticks = element_blank()
  )
```

What if we wanted to order them by wins? Our data has a column called W_L that lists if the team won or lost. The problem is it doens't just say W or L. If the game went to overtime, it lists that. That complicates counting wins. Here's a trick to find a string of text and make that. It's called `grepl` and the basic syntax is grepl for this string in this field and then do what I tell you. In this case, we're going to create a new field called winloss look for W or L (and ignore any OT notation) and give wins a 1 and losses a 0.



```r
winlosslogs <- logs %>% mutate(winloss = case_when(
  grepl("W", W_L) ~ 1, 
  grepl("L", W_L) ~ 0)
)
```

So let's look at turnovers and assists. We'll call it give and take. Does the difference between those two things indicate something when we sort them by wins?


```r
giveandtake <- winlosslogs %>% group_by(Conference, Team) %>% summarise(turnovers = sum(TeamTurnovers), assists = sum(TeamAssists), wins=sum(winloss)) 
```


```r
big10gt <- giveandtake %>% filter(Conference == "Big Ten")
```



```r
ggplot(big10gt) +
  geom_segment(aes(x=reorder(Team, wins), xend=Team, y=turnovers, yend=assists), color="grey") + 
  geom_point(aes(x=reorder(Team, wins), y=turnovers), color="red") + 
  geom_point(aes(x=reorder(Team, wins), y=assists), color="blue") +
  coord_flip()
```

Short answer: Not really.
