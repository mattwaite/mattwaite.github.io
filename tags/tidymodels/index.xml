      <description>I do not know a lot about college basketball. I follow the travails of my employer and a little about the Big Ten Conference as a whole, but at best it’s surface knowledge. I kinda know who is good that we’re going to play and who isn’t. Beyond that, nada.
Which is bad when it comes to tournament time.
My typical pattern of filling out bracket is Have I Heard Of This Team, Do They Have a Legendary Coach or Do I Hate Them For Some Reason.</description>
