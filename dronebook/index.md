# Getting started

In their simplest form, drones are cameras that fly. And they come with all the problems that both a camera and a flying object involve. The problems with cameras -- the ethical issues and the privacy issues -- are ones that are well worn. We've been talking about them since at least the Civil War. The flying parts are newer -- since 1903 -- but never before has a flying camera become more accessible.

Before we get to the laws governing flying cameras, what could you do with one? Our answer: give people a view of something they've never had before, and give them the context they need to understand how big something really is.

But to do that in the United States, you have to pass an FAA test. To be a knowledgeable user, you need to understand the history and the law before you put a flying robot into the skies. And to be a responsible journalist, you need to understand the ethical limitations of what you should and shouldn't do with a drone.

## The FAA Test

To get an FAA Part 107 certificate, you need to first need to meet some criteria:

* You must be 16 years old.
* You must read, write and understand English.
* You must pass the FAA's aeronautical knowledge test.
* You must pass a Department of Homeland Security background check.

Three of the four, you're on your own. This text will help with the test.

The test required to become a licensed drone operator in the United States is given by the Federal Aviation Administration at one of [nearly 700 certified testing facilities across the country](https://www.faa.gov/training_testing/testing/media/test_centers.pdf). If this is the first time you are taking the test, it has 60 multiple-choice questions. If you are renewing your license, it has 40 multiple-choice questions.

The following table comes from the [FAA's Airman Certification Standards](https://www.faa.gov/training_testing/testing/acs/media/uas_acs.pdf). The notes at the end are the author's impressions from speaking with more than 150 people who have passed the test.

| Certification Knowledge Exam| Share      | Number   | Notes                       |
|-----------------------------|------------|----------|-----------------------------|
| Regulations                 | 15-25%     | 9-15     | Expect the higher end       |
| Airspace and Requirements   | 15-25%     | 9-15     | Expect the higher end       |
| Weather                     | 11-16%     | 7-10     | Highly variable             |
| Loading and performance     | 7-11%      | 4-7      | Expect the lower end        |
| Operations                  | 35-45%     | 21-27    | Covers wide array of topics |

The recurrent test -- for those who passed the certification test two years ago and need to re-certify -- has only been offered for a short time, so little is known about it. The FAA says these are the topics covered.

| Recurrent Knowledge Exam   | Topic                        | Share    | Number   |
|----------------------------|------------------------------|----------|----------|
|                            | General                      |          |          |
| Area 1                     | Operating Rules              | 30-40%   | 12-16    |

| Area 3                     | Emergency procedures         | 20-30%   | 8-12     |
|                            | Aeronautical decision-making |          |          |
|                            | Maintenance and inspection   |          |          |

More information about the test:

* It's done on a computer and you will know your score immediately after you submit it.
* You will not be allowed to take anything into the test other than a calculator with no memory functions.
* You will not be allowed to take your cell phone with you.
* You must bring ID to the test.
* The test will cost $150 to take.
* You can take the test again if you fail, but you will have to wait 14 days.
* A passing score is 70 percent.

If you are taking the test for the first time, you can miss 18 questions and still pass. There is only Pass or Fail. There is no bonus for a high score. Anything above a 70 percent is for personal pride.
