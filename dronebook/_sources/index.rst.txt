Getting Started with Drone Journalism
=================================================================

In their simplest form, drones are cameras that fly. And they come with all the problems that both a camera and a flying object involve. The problems with cameras -- the ethical issues and the privacy issues -- are ones that are well worn. We've been talking about them since at least the Civil War. The flying parts are newer -- since 1903 -- but never before has a flying camera become more accessible.

Before we get to the laws governing flying cameras, what could you do with one? Our answer: give people a view of something they've never had before, and give them the context they need to understand how big something really is.

But to do that, you have to understand the history and the law before you put a flying robot into the skies.
