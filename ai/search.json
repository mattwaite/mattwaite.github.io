    "text": "Classroom emergency preparedness and response information\nUNL Alert\nUNL Alert provides free notification by landline, cell phone, text message, e-mail, fax, and pager during an emergency. Visit http://emergency.unl.edu for a link and instructions on how to sign up for alerts pertaining to UNL. If you receive a UNL Alert notification during class, please share the information immediately.\nAdditional Information\nAdditional information about emergency preparedness and response at UNL as well as the university’s operating status can be found on emergency.unl.edu.\nWEATHER EXTREMES\n\nListen to the latest National Weather Service warnings and bulletins on radio and television.\n\nDuring a Tornado\n\nWhen sirens activate, move to the lowest, interior area of building or designated tornado shelter.\nStay away from windows.\nStay near inside wall when possible.\nKeep calm. Even though a warning is issued, the chance of a tornado striking your building or location is slight.\n\nDuring a Winter Storm\n\nIf conditions worsen during the day, the administration may decide to close the university early. When such determination is made, you will be notified through UNL Alert, campus email, and UNL’s Web site.\nDecisions to close for the day are communicated usually by 6 a.m.\nIf roads leading to your home have been closed, caution should be used in determining whether to travel home.\n\nMOBILITY ASSISTANCE\n\nAnyone who needs/wants help with moving to evacuation or shelter-in-place locations should let me know.\nI will locate volunteers students in this class who will assist you in the event we evacuate or shelter-in-place\n\nSHELTER-IN-PLACE (Hostile Intruder, External Hazardous Materials Release)\n\nRemain calm.\nIf it is possible to flee the area safely and avoid danger, do so.\nNotify anyone you encounter to exit the building immediately. Evacuate to a safe area away from the danger and take protective cover. Stay there until help arrives.\nCall UNL Police Department or 9-1-1 with your location if possible. If you cannot get through by phone and have text message capability, text University Police at 41513. Enter the letters UNLPD and then type your message. Dispatch will receive and respond to the message.\nIf flight is impossible, secure yourself in your space. Barricade doors and block windows. Turn off all the lights, close blinds and close and lock all windows and lock and barricade all doors.\nSeek protective cover for yourself and any others (concrete walls, thick desks, filing cabinets may protect you from bullets).\nKeep calm, quiet and out of sight.\nSilence cell phones (mute or turn off cell phone ringer). Consider turning off radios and computer monitors.\nDo not answer the door. If you do not recognize the voice that is giving instructions, do not change your status (stay put). Unknown or unfamiliar voices may be false and designed to give false assurances.\nPlace signs in exterior windows to identify the location of injured persons.\nDo Not Approach Emergency Responders-let them come to you.\nRemain where you are until an “all clear* instruction is given by an authorized known voice.\n\nEVACUATION (Fire, Internal Hazardous Materials Release)\n\nAlways evacuate if the fire alarm sounds.\nIn the event of an evacuation, gather your personal belongings quickly (purse, keys, cell phone, NCard, etc.) and proceed to the nearest exit.\nDo not use the elevator.\nMove away from the problem, use alternative exits.\nHelp those who need assistance moving.\nBe ready to be guided by additional instructions."

We’ll contemplate what it means to think; what is intelligence; what it means to have an augmentation to your intelligence; what that intelligence is good for and not good for; and we’ll try to build one of our own."
