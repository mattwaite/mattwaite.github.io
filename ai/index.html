<p>This is extremely preliminary. At the pace AI is moving, very little set down in Spring 2023 is going to be the same in Fall 2023.</p>
<p>Fall 2023<br>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="course-description">Course description</h3>
<p>AI went from science fiction to current fact with breathtaking speed. Soon, you’ll have AI plugged into every tool you use, including Word, Google Docs and your email. Journalism and communications, let alone society at large, are only starting to grapple with this. This class, the first of its kind at CoJMC, will explore three areas: 1. What is AI, how does it work, what is it good and bad at? 2. How can you use current public AI tools to be a better writer, reporter, communicator and human? 3. What if we trained our own AI on a local news source? It’s possible with open tools. Would it be any good? Would it be accurate enough to be useful? What could you do with your own AI tool?</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> None.</p>
<p><strong>Required Materials:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>A functioning laptop computer that you must bring with you to class every time and ~7 GB of free hard drive space.</p></li>
<li><p>Online materials and class handouts, as needed.</p></li>
<li><p>Slack, installed on your computer and on your phone.</p></li>
<li><p>A willingness to try something that may not work, and an open mind that something might be a terrible idea.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Build your own AI:</strong> At the end of the semester, we will work with open source tools to create our own text AI out of a corpus of text from the Daily Nebraskan. You’ll build your AI through an account at the Holland Computing Center. You will also evalute it for accuracy, quality and usefulness. At the end, you’ll write a report about it’s strengths, weaknesses, successes, failures and suitability to serve campus.</p>
<p><strong>Assignments:</strong> Regularly throughout the semester, there will be challenges covering a topic around AI. Assignments will include exploring what is thought and how AI approaches it, prompt engineering and refining queries and creating works to help others use AI tools more effectively while avoiding academic dishonesty.</p>
<p><strong>Quizzes:</strong> To reinforce the in-class lectures and the course readings, there will be regular quizzes. They will be short and on Canvas.</p>
<p><strong>Class participation and attendance:</strong> You are bad at college if you don’t know what this means. Get involved in class, speak up, ask questions, challenge ideas and, most importantly, show up. This is how I determine who gets rounded up when you have an 89.4 and who doesn’t. Skip class and you won’t get any benefit of the doubt.</p>
<p>NOTE: Canvas automatically deducts 40 percent per day an assignment is late. If it’s due at 3:30 p.m. and you turn it in at 3:40, you’ll lose points.</p>
<p><strong>Other learning opportunities</strong></p>
<p>News Nerd Slack: I use <a href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a> as a way for students to get help from each other and me when we’re not in class or not even in the building. I have one News Nerd Slack that includes my current code classes, students of past classes and alumni who have gone on to do data journalism professionally. You’ll be added to the slack during the semester, and at the end, I’ll remove you unless you tell me otherwise. If you like it, stay. If not, no worries and no judgments.</p>
</section>
<section id="attendance-policy" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="attendance-policy">Attendance policy</h3>
<p>I do not take attendance, but I do actively work at punishing people who don’t go to class. I cover things directly relevant to the work at hand. I will tell you what you need to do to get a good grade. I will tell you how you’re going to go wrong before you do it. And if you skip class, I’ll know it because you’ll do the thing I told you not to do.</p>
<p>So show up. If you’re sick or even think you might be sick, don’t come to class, but tell me before class and we’ll work it out. If you have COVID or are in quarantine because of an exposure, contact me about a Zoom link. Bottom line: Show up.</p>

<section id="learning-outcomes" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="learning-outcomes">Learning outcomes:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Explore the current state of AI</li>
<li>Experiment with prompt engineering and query refining to get useful results.</li>
<li>Critically analyze AI outputs for use in creative fields like journalism and media.</li>
<li>Create your own AI tool using a corpus of text.</li>
</ul>

<section id="academic-integrity" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="academic-integrity">Academic integrity:</h3>
<p>Every student must adhere to the policy on academic integrity set forth in the UNL Student Code of Conduct as outlined in the UNL Bulletin. Students who plagiarize may receive a failing grade on an assignment or for an entire course and may be reported to the Student Judicial Review Board. The work a student submits in a class must be the student’s own work and must be work completed for that particular class and assignment. Students wishing to build on an old project or work on a similar project in two classes must discuss this with both professors. Academic dishonesty includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>handing in another’s work or part of another’s work as your own.</li>
<li>turning in one of your old papers (including something you wrote in high school) for a current class.</li>
<li>turning in the same or similar paper for two different classes,</li>
<li>using notes or other study aids or otherwise obtaining another’s answers for a quiz or an examination.</li>
</ul>
<p>Anything and everything you include in your papers that comes from another source must be attributed with proper citation. That includes ideas and opinions. Plagiarism consists of using phrases, sentences or paragraphs from any source and republishing them without alteration or attribution. The sources include, but are not limited to, books, magazines, newspapers, television or radio reports, Web sites and other students’ papers.</p>

<section id="recording-of-lecturesdiscussions" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="recording-of-lecturesdiscussions">Recording of Lectures/Discussions</h3>
<p>So as to create a classroom environment in which everyone may feel comfortable participating in discussions, it is expected that no audio or video recordings of class will be made without the prior knowledge and consent of the instructor. Students with disabilities for which reasonable accommodation would include making such recordings should work with the Services for Students with Disabilities office and the instructor to make arrangements.</p>
</section>
<section id="diversity-and-inclusiveness" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="diversity-and-inclusiveness">Diversity and Inclusiveness</h3>
<p>The University of Nebraska-Lincoln does not discriminate on the basis of race, ethnicity, color, national origin, sex (including pregnancy), religion, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, genetic information, veteran status, marital status, and/or political affiliation.</p>
<p>The College of Journalism and Mass Communications values diversity in the broadest sense - gender, age, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, economic status, physical and intellectual ability, religion, education and geography. We recognize that acknowledging, building understanding and incorporating diversity throughout the curriculum prepare students for communications careers in a global society. As communicators, we know journalism, advertising, public relations, broadcasting and other forms of strategic communications must reflect society in order to be credible, reliable and effective. Inaccuracies or biases in our written, spoken and visual reports mean we have failed as journalists. Diverse voices and perspectives improve our accuracy and truthfulness. In advertising and public relations, we cannot succeed if we do not understand the value of or know how to create inclusive communications that reflect a diverse society.</p>

<li>Silence cell phones (mute or turn off cell phone ringer). Consider turning off radios and computer monitors.</li>
<li>Do not answer the door. If you do not recognize the voice that is giving instructions, do not change your status (stay put). Unknown or unfamiliar voices may be false and designed to give false assurances.</li>
<li>Place signs in exterior windows to identify the location of injured persons.</li>
<li>Do Not Approach Emergency Responders-let them come to you.</li>
<li>Remain where you are until an “all clear* instruction is given by an authorized known voice.</li>
</ul>
