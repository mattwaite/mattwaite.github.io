Students may not use cell phones and electronic devices (including earbuds) while at school, except as permitted in this handbook.
● Personal cell phones and electronic devices (including earbuds) will remain off and out of sight and may only be used during class time for educational purposes. Students must comply with each teacher’s classroom rules regarding cell phone/electronic device use in class.
● Students may use cell phones and electronic devices (including earbuds) on the school sidewalks and in the common areas of the school before and after school, so long as they do not create a distraction or a disruption.

● Students may not use cell phones and electronic devices (including earbuds) while riding in a school vehicle unless they have express permission to do so from the vehicle’s driver.
Students are personally and solely responsible for the security of their cell phones and/or electronic devices (including earbuds) or any other electronic devices. The school district is not responsible for the theft, loss, or damage of a cell phone or any communication made to or from a cell phone.
Students who violate this policy may have their cell phones and electronic devices (including earbuds) or other electronic devices confiscated immediately. The administration will return confiscated devices to the offending student’s parent or guardian after meeting with the parent or guardian to discuss the violation. Students who violate this policy may, at the discretion of the school’s administration, be subject to additional discipline, up to
and including suspension or expulsion.

● Level Three: The device is taken to the office and the student must pick it up there at the end of the day.
Protocol: A staff member will take away the student’s device and it will be given to the office. The student may pick up the device at the end of the school day.
