If we multiply the rate by the time, we’ll get the distance. If you remember just a bit about algebra, you know we can move these things around. If we know two of them, we can figure out the third. So, for instance, if we know the distance and we know the time, we can use algebra to divide the distance by the time to get the rate. d/t = r or distance/time = rate In 2012, the South Florida Sun Sentinel found a story in this formula. People were dying on South Florida tollways in terrible car accidents. What made these different from other car fatal car accidents that happen every day in the US? Police officers driving way too fast were causing them. But do police regularly speed on tollways or were there just a few random and fatal exceptions? Thanks to Florida’s public records laws, the Sun Sentinel got records from the toll transponders in police cars in south Florida. The transponders recorded when a car went through a given place. And then it would do it again. And again. Given that those places are fixed – they’re toll plazas – and they had the time it took to go from one toll plaza to another, they had the distance and the time. It took high school algebra to find how fast police officers were driving. And the results were shocking. Twenty percent of police officers had exceeded 90 miles per hour on toll roads. In a 13-month period, officers drove between 90 and 110 mph more than 5,000 times. And these were just instances found on toll roads. Not all roads have tolls. The story was a stunning find, and the newspaper documented case after case of police officers violating the law and escaping punishment. And, in 2013, they won the Pulitzer Prize for Public Service. All with simple high school algebra. 1.1 Modern data journalism It’s a single word in a single job description, but a Buzzfeed job posting in 2017 is another indicator in what could be a profound shift in how data journalism is both practiced and taught. “We’re looking for someone with a passion for news and a commitment to using data to find amazing, important stories — both quick hits and deeper analyses that drive conversations,” the posting seeking a data journalist says. It goes on to list five things BuzzFeed is looking for: Excellent collaborator, clear writer, deep statistical understanding, knowledge of obtaining and restructuring data. And then there’s this: “You should have a strong command of at least one toolset that (a) allows for filtering, joining, pivoting, and aggregating tabular data, and (b) enables reproducible workflows.” This is not the data journalism of 20 years ago. When it started, it was a small group of people in newsrooms using spreadsheets and databases. Data journalism now encompases programming for all kinds of purposes, product development, user interface design, data visualization and graphics on top of more traditional skills like analyzing data and writing stories. In this book, you’ll get a taste of modern data journalism through programming in R, a statistics language. You’ll be challenged to think programmatically while thinking about a story you can tell to readers in a way that they’ll want to read. They might seem like two different sides of the brain – mutually exclusive skills. They aren’t. I’m confident you’ll see programming is a creative endeavor and storytelling can be analytical. Combining them together has the power to change policy, expose injustice and deeply inform. 1.2 Installations This book is all in the R statistical language. To follow along, you’ll do the following: Install the R language on your computer. Go to the R Project website, click download R and select a mirror closest to your location. Then download the version for your computer. Install R Studio Desktop. The free version is great. Going forward, you’ll see passages like this: install.packages(&quot;tidyverse&quot;) That is code that you’ll need to run in your R Studio. When you see that, you’ll know what to do. 1.3 About this book This book is the collection of class materials for the author’s Data Journalism class at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln’s College of Journalism and Mass Communications. There’s some things you should know about it: It is free for students. The topics will remain the same but the text is going to be constantly tinkered with.
