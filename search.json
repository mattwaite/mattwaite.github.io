    "text": "Matt Waite is a professor of practice in the College of Journalism and Mass Communications at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.\nSince he joined the faculty in 2011, he founded the Drone Journalism Lab, the first of its kind at a journalism school. His students have used drones to report news in six countries on three continents. He regularly speaks about the legal and ethical complexities of using drones at conferences around the world and is frequently consulted by media organizations about their potential. He also teaches courses in data journalism, web development and the intersection of storytelling and technology. He created an open learning lab for students called Maker Hours, helped develop an interdisciplinary minor in Informatics and serves on the Publications Board of the Daily Nebraskan. In 2016, he received the University of Nebraska’s Innovation, Development and Entrepreneurship Award and was inducted into the Nebraska Press Association’s Hall of Fame in October.\nFrom 2007-2011, he was a hybrid programmer/journalist for the St. Petersburg Times where he developed PolitiFact, a website that fact checks what politicians say. The site became the first website awarded the Pulitzer Prize in 2009.\nBefore becoming a web developer, he was an award-winning investigative reporter. He began his journalism career at the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette in Little Rock, covering police and breaking news, including the crash of American Airlines flight 1420 in 1999. In 2000, he moved to the St. Petersburg Times. From 2005-2007, he co-authored a series of award-winning stories about Florida’s vanishing wetlands. That work was later expanded into a book, “Paving Paradise: Florida’s Vanishing Wetlands and the Failure of No Net Loss,” published in 2009 by the University Press of Florida."

    "text": "Once again, I attempted to predict the outcome of the NCAA tournament using machine learning, and I had a class-load of students try the same.\nIf you like the madness part of March Madness, this year is for you.\nIt is not for machine learning algorithms based on regular season performance. At least not mine.\nOf the 14 brackets I and my students produced, using 14 different methods, we came up with 7 unique national title winners.\nZero of them are right.\nThe best brackets had two of the four Final Four teams, but none picked a team still playing now to win it all with the Final Four set.\nI had hope for my bracket picking algorithm this year. It had what felt like a good mix of upsets and favorites, some madness and some method.\nWhat follows is a post mortem and an attempt to figure out what went wrong. If anything went wrong. How do you predict St. Peter’s? You don’t. It’s what makes this fun.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(tidymodels)\nlibrary(zoo)\nlibrary(hoopR)\nlibrary(gt)\n\nset.seed(1234)\n\nkenpom &lt;-

Reference, I calculated season long unweighted offensive and defensive efficiency margins, threw in KenPom’s luck metric and, at the last minute, decided to create a recency bias metric. What I did was compare the season-long efficiency margin of teams to the same metric from their last 10 games. If they were overplaying their season numbers, that gave them a positive measure. I was trying to capture teams who came into the tournament hot, or who were limping into the tournament based on their regular season resume but missing stars or just playing terrible.\n\n\nCode\nsummary(cumulative_recipe) %&gt;%\n  select(variable, role) %&gt;% \n  filter(role != \"ID\") %&gt;%\n  gt() %&gt;%\n  tab_header(\n    title = \"The predictors\",\n    subtitle = \"A mix of efficiencies, ratings and recency bias.\"\n  ) %&gt;%  \n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"**By:** Matt Waite\")\n  ) %&gt;% \n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  ) %&gt;% \n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")\n  ) %&gt;%\n  tab_style(\n     locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n     style = list(\n       cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(3)),\n       cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size=12)\n     )\n   ) %&gt;%\n  opt_row_striping() %&gt;% \n  opt_table_lines(\"none\")\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      The predictors\n    \n    \n      A mix of efficiencies, ratings and recency bias.\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      variable\n      role\n    \n  \n  \n    opponent_efficiency_margin\npredictor\n    team_efficiency_margin\npredictor\n    team_sos\npredictor\n    team_srs\npredictor\n    opponent_sos\npredictor\n    opponent_srs\npredictor\n    opponent_luck\npredictor\n    team_luck\npredictor\n    opponent_recency\npredictor\n    team_recency\npredictor\n    TeamResult\noutcome\n  \n  \n    \n      By: Matt Waite\n    \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\nIn the run up to the tournament, I used both a logistic regression and support vector machine algorithm, but got very similar results, so I stuck with the more simple logistic regression.\nIn testing, my model was calling college basketball games correctly about 74 percent of the time, so I knew I was going to need to get lucky on a few games. But isn’t that filling out a bracket?\nResult? I did not get lucky.\nParticularly in the Midwest Regional. My models labored to produce a Creighton vs USC Elite Eight match-up that sent USC to the Final Four. While Creighton nearly upset Kansas with half a lineup, USC bombed out in the first round.

That 0-4 on those. None of them made it. The Baylor repeat that I predicted died in the second round at the hands of North Carolina, the highest seeded team to make the Final Four.\nGoing into the Final Four, I’m in the 16th percentile of ESPN brackets, good enough for 14.6 millionth place. Last year, I was in the 38th percentile.\nThe best bracket in my class is in the 88th percentile, with another in the 86th. Only two students did worse than I did.\nWe are what they grow beyond.\nThinking about this bracket, I wanted to try rolling with something that didn’t just bite KenPom and make models out of his data. I wanted to see if I could get to a similar place without re-walking the same ground. I’ve got a year to work in this, but my energy is going to be focused on weighting competition and opponents throughout the season. If of two minds about this: As a Big Ten denizen, I have to wonder if beating up on each other for a whole season is why the Big Ten fades in the tournament. So I’m curious about a Fatigue Factor of some variety. At the same time, how does that explain St. Peter’s? Not sure it does, but I’m not sure there’s a model anywhere that’s going to.\nThe code I wrote to make this relied heavily on hoopR and tidymodels."

    "title": "A simple example of AI agents(?) doing journalism(?) work",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Let’s start this with some confessions:\n\nI’m at best an enthusiastic amateur with AI. I know more than most, and I know nothing in the grand scheme.\nExample: I’m not sure I have any idea of what an AI agent is. I think I do, but there’s so much marketing hype around them that I can’t know for sure. People much, much, much smarter than I am aren’t sure either.\nI teeter on the edge of seeing AI as a fascinating, remarkable alien intelligence (to borrow Ethan Mollick’s description) that we have yet to fully understand and AI is the mother of all solutions in search of a problem when it comes to journalism. All the so-called big problems AI solves in journalism – more content to sell ads against! – nobody wants.\n\nSomething I’ve been coming around to, though, is maybe there isn’t a Manhattan Project level world changing use case for AI. Maybe Chris Albon has the right of it, that the real value is AI saving a human an hour of work … millions of times a day.\nFor months I’ve been trying to think of some moon-shot idea to use AI to do … something, anything … big. And every thing I came up with would be terrible, destructive, or flat-out-insane to deploy without massive human investment, and then what would the point be.\nAnd then, randomly, one day a confluence of ideas popped into my head and what fell out is an example of AI agents(?) doing the work of journalism(?) that actually works.\nThe ideas that collided in my brain were:\n\nThis Francesco Marconi tweet from April that I think did the best job of laying out a vision for AI agents in journalism. At least it’s the one that made the most sense to me.\nThis R Package wrapping the Google Gemini API.\nGemini having a free tier to try some stuff out. You get 15 requests a minute – one every 4 seconds – and 1,500 a day.\nThe “aim small, miss small” mantra in teaching marksmanship.\n\n\nWhy R and not Python?\nThe honest truth is there is no good reason why I’m using R to do this vs Python, which most of the AI world is using. The reason is because I teach Data Journalism to undergrads using R at the Harvard of the Plains and believe strongly that I can take absolute beginners – people who can’t spell code – from zero to data analysis faster with the R and the Tidyverse than I can with Python and Pandas. So I have a hammer, this here looks like a nail, and so we’re doing this with R. But there’s absolutely nothing special about this code that you couldn’t match in Python.\nWhen I teach Data Journalism, I use population estimates from the US Census Bureau to teach students how to calculate percent change. That way, we can see which counties in the state grew the fastest and who shrank the fastest. It’s a story as old as time in the Great State of Nebraska. Rural areas are shrinking, urban areas are growing.\nAn extremely common thing to do with this data is to make a map. Here’s the 2022-2023 change map in Datawrapper for Nebraska.\n\n\n\nIf you click on a county, you’ll get a pop up box that gives you the county name and then the data. Population in 2023, population in 2022 and the perecent change. It’s been done a million times before. It does the job.\nBut what if we could make it better? What if we had small narrative summaries for each county? An a headline for each one? Can I assign a human to do this? 100 percent I can. I have an army of undergrads and a gradebook to hold over them. I assure you, if I was cruel enough, we could do this for all 3,400 counties in the US.\nBut why do that when we can have AI do this in minutes instead of making humans miserable for hours?\n\n\nFeeding Gemini numbers, getting back narrative\nThe gemini.R package couldn’t make sending something to Gemini any more simple. The hardest part – which is not hard – is getting an API key from Google. How do you do that? Go here: https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey. So I always have mine and don’t lose it, I set it as an environment variable. To do that, run usethis::edit_r_environ() and add GOOGLE_GEMINI_KEY=\"your key here\" to your environment, save that file and restart R Studio (or whatever IDE you use).\nYou can test it out with something like this:\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(gemini.R)\nlibrary(glue)\n\nsetAPI(Sys.getenv(\"GOOGLE_GEMINI_KEY\"))\n\ngemini(\"Write me a haiku about the joy and sadness of being a Nebraska football fan\")\n\nWhat do you get back?\n\nRed and white, we cheer, Hope springs eternal, then fades, Another close loss.\n\nOuch.\nBut that’s really it. Just gemini(\"Words here\") and off it goes to an AI and back comes the results in plain text. So the first hard part is turning data into a text block we can send to Gemini. So I pull a dataset of Nebraska county population estimates, I’m going to thin the number of columns I’m working with first, then create the percent change column, create a GEOID column made up of the state and county FIPS number so I can join it to my map later, rank the counties by population change and then mash it all together into a single text blob called the base_narrative. It’s literally just Column Name: Number, Column Name: Number repeated over and over.\n\ncountypopchange &lt;- read_csv(\"https://the-art-of-data-journalism.github.io/tutorial-data/census-estimates/nebraska.csv\")\n\nstatenarrative &lt;- countypopchange |&gt; \n  select(COUNTY, STATE, CTYNAME, STNAME, POPESTIMATE2023, POPESTIMATE2022, NPOPCHG2023, NATURALCHG2023, NETMIG2023) |&gt;\n  mutate(POPPERCENTCHANGE = ((POPESTIMATE2023-POPESTIMATE2022)/POPESTIMATE2022)*100) |&gt; \n  mutate(GEOID = paste0(COUNTY, STATE)) |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(POPPERCENTCHANGE)) |&gt; \n  mutate(PCTCHANGERANK = row_number()) |&gt; \n  mutate(base_narrative = glue(\n  \"County: {CTYNAME}, Population in 2023: {POPESTIMATE2023}, Population in 2022: {POPESTIMATE2022}, Population change: {NPOPCHG2023}, Percent change: {POPPERCENTCHANGE}, Percent change rank in {STNAME}: {PCTCHANGERANK}, Natural change (births vs deaths): {NATURALCHG2023}, Net migration: {NETMIG2023}\")) \n\nNow we need to make an agent. It helped me to think of journalism as an assembly line. We have data as raw materials, and now we need to assign a worker to a process to convert raw material into something new. In any news process, the first worker is the journalist creating the thing. A reporter going to city hall. A photographer going to a breaking news event. So it makes sense that our first agent is the author of the narratives for each county.\nLike any good LLM prompt, we’re going to start by giving our author agent a role – a job to do. Our agent is a demographics journalist from Nebraska. We give that agent a task with some details – keep it short but approachable. And then we give it the data.\nBelow the role is a function that takes in a county name, finds the base_narrative for that county and then we merge together the author_role and the base_narrative when we send it to Gemini. We store the results in a variable called … results and do a little cleanup on it (Gemini likes to cram newline characters in the results). I’ve added a five second sleep between every county to keep from running afoul of Google’s free tier API limits. Theoretically I should be able to set it to 4 seconds, but I don’t need my account banned over a second. With those pauses, our author takes about 8 minutes to write small narratives about each of the 93 counties.\n\nauthor_role &lt;- \"You are a demographics journalist from Nebraska. Your job today is to write short -- 2-3 sentence -- summaries of population estimates from the Census Bureau for each county in the state. I will provide you the name of the county and a series of population numbers for the county. Your job is to turn it into a concise but approachable summary of what happened in that county. Here is the data you have to work with: \"\n\nauthor_agent &lt;- function(county) {\n  county_narrative &lt;- statenarrative |&gt; filter(CTYNAME == county)\n  results &lt;- gemini(paste(author_role, county_narrative$base_narrative))\n  results &lt;- gsub(\"\\n\", \"\", results)\n  Sys.sleep(5)\n  print(paste(\"Processed\", county_narrative$CTYNAME))\n  \n  # Return a single-row tibble\n  tibble(county = county_narrative$CTYNAME, base_narrative = county_narrative$base_narrative, capsule_narrative = results)\n}\n\n# Use map_df to directly create the final dataframe\nauthor_agent_results &lt;- purrr::map_df(statenarrative$CTYNAME, author_agent)\n\nWhen it’s done, we end up with a dataframe called author_agent_results which has the county name and the new narrative.\nWe could stop here, but why do that? Good journalism is often a layered process involving multiple sets of eyes reviewing the work along the way, and other skilled people adding to the product. So who would normally get this next? How about we fact check the work?\nExact same pattern, just a different role for the AI.\n\nfact_check_role &lt;- \"You are a fact-checking editor. Your job today is to compare the information in the base narrative to the capsule narrative in the data provided to you. You will compare each number in the base narrative to the capsule narrative to make sure they are the same, and then you will check the context of how each number was used in comparison to the original base narrative. To be clear: the base narrative is the correct information. When you are finished, return just a single word. If everything is correct, respond Correct. If any part of it is not correct, respond Incorrect. \"\n\nfact_check_agent &lt;- function(county_input) {\n  county_narrative &lt;- author_agent_results |&gt; filter(county == county_input)\n  input_string &lt;- paste(\n    fact_check_role,\n    \"Base narrative:\", county_narrative$base_narrative,\n    \"Capsule narrative:\", county_narrative$capsule_narrative)\n  results &lt;- gemini(input_string)\n  results &lt;- gsub(\"\\n\", \"\", results)\n  Sys.sleep(5)\n  print(paste(\"Processed\", county_input))\n\n  # Return a single-row tibble\n  tibble(county = county_narrative$county, base_narrative = county_narrative$base_narrative, capsule_narrative = county_narrative$capsule_narrative, fact_check_results = results)\n}\n\n# Use map_df to directly create the final dataframe\nfact_check_agent_results &lt;- purrr::map_df(author_agent_results$county, fact_check_agent)\n\nHonestly, this part needs work. It flags about 10 percent of the results as being incorrect, but they aren’t. The reason it flags them is the author agent was a little glib with the numbers – saying “a slight increase natural growth because of more births” without giving the numbers themselves. The fact checking editor bot here does not like that. So it might need a little tweaking to see if we can get the fact checker to lighten up a bit.\nQuit now? Nah. How about we add a little local flair to each capsule. Google knows a lot of stuff, so why not add some kind of geographic context to each county. To do that, I created a rewrite editor and commanded it to add details like the region of the state, the county seat, the largest city, or some other detail to a single clause in the original narrative.\n\nrewrite_role &lt;- \"You are a re-write editor. Your job is to add a little local geographic context to a demographic capsule about a county in Nebraska. You'll do this by adding a clause to the paragraph I'll provide you. That clause should tell you something about that county. Maybe the county seat, or the largest city, or the region of the state it is in. We just need a clause added to one of the sentences, and do not do anything to show where you added it. Here is the capsule: \"\n\nrewrite_agent &lt;- function(county_input) {\n  county_narrative &lt;- fact_check_agent_results |&gt; filter(county == county_input)\n  results &lt;- gemini(paste(rewrite_role, county_narrative$capsule_narrative))\n  results &lt;- gsub(\"**\", \"\", results, fixed = TRUE)\n  Sys.sleep(5)\n  print(paste(\"Processed\", county_narrative$county))\n  \n  # Return a single-row tibble\n  tibble(county = county_narrative$county, base_narrative = county_narrative$base_narrative, capsule_narrative = county_narrative$capsule_narrative, rewrite_county_narrative = results)\n}\n\n# Use map_df to directly create the final dataframe\nrewrite_agent_results &lt;- purrr::map_df(fact_check_agent_results$county, rewrite_agent)\n\nOne last thing: Why not give every county a headline instead of just simply having the county name in the map? Done and done.\n\nheadline_writer_role &lt;- \"You are a headline writer. Your job is to write a short headline based on the summary given to you. This headline should be short -- it has to fit into a small space -- so bear that in mind. Here is the capsule: \"\n\nheadline_agent &lt;- function(county_input) {\n  county_narrative &lt;- rewrite_agent_results |&gt; filter(county == county_input)\n  results &lt;- gemini(paste(headline_writer_role, county_narrative$rewrite_county_narrative))\n  results &lt;- gsub(\"\\n\", \"\", results, fixed = TRUE)\n  Sys.sleep(5)\n  print(paste(\"Processed\", county_narrative$county))\n  \n  # Return a single-row tibble\n  tibble(county = county_narrative$county, base_narrative = county_narrative$base_narrative, capsule_narrative = county_narrative$capsule_narrative, rewrite_county_narrative = county_narrative$rewrite_county_narrative, headline = results)\n}\n\n# Use map_df to directly create the final dataframe\nheadline_agent_results &lt;- purrr::map_df(rewrite_agent_results$county, headline_agent)\n\nHere is the exact same map, same data, but now with headlines and narratives written for each county. Click on one and you’ll get a human-friendly narrative about that county, and the numbers below that if you want them.\n\n\n\nIs Christopher Nolan going to make a movie about this? Not hardly. Have I “Saved Journalism”? Nope. Not even close. Did I save a human a few minutes of drudgery 93 + 93 + 93 + 93 times? Yes. Yes I did. Is this idea extensible and repeatable? It sure is. I think that’s good enough for now.\n\n\nWhere to go from here\nFrom here, what this needs is a block of code that pushes the results of the headline editor agent to Google Sheets, where a human can go through each one and make sure everything is fine. I’ve tried to do that in R Studio, which is not great, and limits the number of people who could do this. And to be sure, it needs to be done. Nebrasaka geography nerds – there are tens of us! – will able to find Arthur County, one of the smallest counties in the US by population. For those who can’t, the rewrite bot describes Arthur as “located in the northwestern corner of the state and home to the county seat of Arthur.” Half of that is objectively true. Arthur is much more arguably in the west-central part of the state, but it really depends on where you draw the lines. It’s arguable enough that a good local editor would drop that part and leave the county seat part, which is correct. Arthur County’s county seat is … Arthur.\nThen, as a last step, I would automate the process of creating the Datawrapper chart with the DatawRapper library, which accesses the service’s API. Imagine the Census Bureau publishing the data, and then in a matter of minutes you have that map done and online. To do that, you’d have to have a little budget for API calls so you aren’t waiting 32 minutes for the whole thing to run – 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 minutes for each step. But even then, is there really a competitive contest over who can publish Census maps in Nebraska fast enough? No. \nBut if you, like me, are thinking about how we’re going to incorporate AI into journalism in ways that make sense, don’t risk the reputation of the organization you work for and don’t horrify your audience to a point that they turn away from you for feeding them AI dreck they don’t want or care about, this is an example of just how to do that.\nAim small, miss small."

    "text": "Nebraska fans haven’t had the best time watching basketball lately. The last two seasons have featured only seven wins in each season. This season they only won three games in the Big Ten, but that was an improvement over last season when they only won two.\nBut anyone watching Nebraska basketball this season could see there was a difference between last season’s squad and this one. And given that the Big Ten was rated as the best conference in college basketball during the season, it begs the question: Is Nebraska that bad?\nIn fact, are they the best worst team in college basketball?\nLet’s take a look at some numbers.\nSports Reference’s college basketball site produces a Simple Rating System and Strength of Schedule number for each team. The SRS is a mix of average point differential and strength of schedule.

    "text": "Feature engineering\nThe data I’m using is scraped from Sports Reference and it’s the box scores of every Division I college basketball game since the start of the 2014-2015 season. The data is a little funny in that each game is in there twice – I’m scraping school pages, so the Team is always that school, and the Opponent is someone else. So a game between two Division I schools will appear twice – one for each Team.\nMy logic in picking predictors was that how efficient teams are with the ball is important, so I estimated the number of possessions and then calculated offensive and defensive ratings (which is points per 100 possessions).\nI then wanted some kind of a metric of how good of a win or how bad of a loss a particular game was. So I calculated the score margin and added it to the opponent’s simple rating from Sports Reference. So a team losing close to a good team isn’t a bad loss. A bad team beating a good team is a great win. And so on. So if you’re a team beating up on bad teams, you don’t get a lot of credit for that.\nThen, I used the teams cumulative mean over the course of the season to estimate what they would have going into the game. Obviously, you can’t know how a team will play going into a game, but I figure that they’ll be somewhere around their cumulative mean, which should pick up if the team is playing better or worse over a few games.\nThen, for tournament purposes, I cut that to the last 10 games of the season.

    "text": "Modeling with Tidymodels\nThere’s a growing supply of tutorials on how to use tidymodels to do machine learning, and one of the authors of the library, Julia Silge, has a long list of posts that greatly helped me figure this all out.\nTo start the modeling processing, I’m going to split my data into training and testing sets.\n\n\nCode\nbracket_split &lt;- initial_split(bothsides, prop = .8)\nbracket_train &lt;- training(bracket_split)\nbracket_test &lt;- testing(bracket_split)\n\n\nI then created a simple recipe, which doesn’t do much except set aside some fields as ID fields instead of making them predictors.\n\n\nCode\nxg_rec &lt;- \n  recipe(Outcome ~ ., data = bracket_train) %&gt;%\n  update_role(Team, Opponent, Date, Season, new_role = \"ID\")\n\nsummary(xg_rec)\n\n\n# A tibble: 15 × 4\n   variable                            type    role      source  \n   &lt;chr&gt;                               &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;   \n 1 Season                              nominal ID        original\n 2 Team                                nominal ID        original\n 3 Date                                date    ID        original\n 4 Opponent                            nominal ID        original\n 5 Cumulative_Mean_Offensive           numeric predictor original\n 6 Cumulative_Mean_Defensive           numeric predictor original\n 7 Cumulative_Mean_WinQuality          numeric predictor original\n 8 TeamSRS                             numeric predictor original\n 9 TeamSOS                             numeric predictor original\n10 Opponent_Cumulative_Offensive       numeric predictor original\n11 Opponent_Cumulative_Mean_Defensive  numeric predictor original\n12 Opponent_Cumulative_Mean_WinQuality numeric predictor original\n13 OpponentSRS                         numeric predictor original\n14 OpponentSOS                         numeric predictor original\n15 Outcome                             nominal outcome   original\n\n\nThen I define my model, which I am going to tune all of the hyperparameters in an xgboost model later.\n\n\nCode\nxg_mod &lt;-   boost_tree(\n  trees = tune(), \n  learn_rate = tune(),\n  tree_depth = tune(), \n  min_n = tune(),\n  loss_reduction = tune(), \n  sample_size = tune(), \n  mtry = tune(), \n  ) %&gt;% \n  set_mode(\"classification\") %&gt;% \n  set_engine(\"xgboost\", nthread = cores)\n\n\nWith a recipe and a model definition, I can create a workflow, which will now handle a whole lot of chores for me.\n\n\nCode\nbracket_wflow &lt;- \n  workflow() %&gt;% \n  add_model(xg_mod) %&gt;% \n  add_recipe(xg_rec)\n\n\nTo tune my hyperparameters, I am going to use a Latin Hypercube, which is a method for generating near-random samples of paremeters to try.\n\n\nCode\nxgb_grid &lt;- grid_latin_hypercube(\n  trees(),\n  tree_depth(),\n  min_n(),\n  loss_reduction(),\n  sample_size = sample_prop(),\n  finalize(mtry(), bracket_train),\n  learn_rate(),\n  size = 30\n)\n\n\nTo test these hyperparemeters, I am going to make some cross-fold valiations samples that we can use.\n\n\nCode\nbracket_folds &lt;- vfold_cv(bracket_train)\n\n\nAnd now comes the part that makes my laptop fan turn into a jet engine. The next block uses parallel processing to try the 30 samples from the Latin Hypercube and tests it against my cross fold validation samples. It … takes a while.\n\n\nCode\ndoParallel::registerDoParallel(cores = cores)\n\nxgb_res &lt;- tune_grid(\n  bracket_wflow,\n  resamples = bracket_folds,\n  grid = xgb_grid,\n  control = control_grid(save_pred = TRUE)\n)\n\ndoParallel::stopImplicitCluster()\n\n\nBut out of it, we get the best combination of hyperparameters to use as inputs into our model. I’m going to use area under the curve as my evaluation metric to determine what is best.\n\n\nCode\nbest_roc &lt;- select_best(xgb_res, \"roc_auc\")\n\n\nAnd I can now feed that into my final workflow.\n\n\nCode\nfinal_xgb &lt;- finalize_workflow(\n  bracket_wflow,\n  best_roc\n)\n\n\nAnd I can now train a model to use on bracket games.\n\n\nCode\nxg_fit &lt;- \n  final_xgb %&gt;% \n  fit(data = bracket_train)"

    "text": "Play In Games\nI’m not going to bore you with the tedium of applying this to every game in each round. My notebook that does it all is almost 900 lines of code long, and this post is already getting long. But here’s an example of what it looks like using the play-in games.\nTo do this, I needed to make a tibble of the games, with the team and opponent. The date doesn’t matter, but it’s needed because my model is expecting it.\nThen, I need to get the right data for each team and join it to them so each game has the predictors the model is expecting. Then, using the model, we can predict the outcome.\n\n\nCode\nplayin &lt;- tibble(\n  Team=\"Norfolk State\",\n  Opponent=\"Appalachian State\",\n  Date = as.Date(\"2021-03-19\")\n) %&gt;% add_row(\n  Team=\"Wichita State\",\n  Opponent=\"Drake\",\n  Date = as.Date(\"2021-03-19\")\n) %&gt;% add_row(\n  Team=\"Mount St. Mary's\",\n  Opponent=\"Texas Southern\",\n  Date = as.Date(\"2021-03-19\")\n) %&gt;% add_row(\n  Team=\"Michigan State\",\n  Opponent=\"UCLA\",\n  Date = as.Date(\"2021-03-19\")\n)\n\nplayingames &lt;- selectedgames %&gt;% \n  group_by(Team) %&gt;% \n  filter(Date == max(Date), Season == \"2020-2021\") %&gt;% \n  select(-Date, -Opponent, -Outcome) %&gt;% \n  right_join(playin)\n\n\nJoining, by = \"Team\"\n\n\nCode\nplayingames &lt;- opponentgames %&gt;% \n  group_by(Opponent) %&gt;% \n  filter(Date == max(Date)) %&gt;% \n  ungroup()  %&gt;% \n  select(-Season, -Date, -Outcome) %&gt;% \n  right_join(playingames, by=c(\"Opponent\")) %&gt;% \n  select(Team, everything())\n\nplayinround &lt;- xg_fit %&gt;% \n  predict(new_data = playingames) %&gt;%\n  bind_cols(playingames) \n\nplayinround &lt;- xg_fit %&gt;% \n  predict(new_data = playinround, type=\"prob\") %&gt;%\n  bind_cols(playinround)\n\nplayinround %&gt;% select(Team, .pred_class, Opponent, .pred_L) %&gt;% \n  gt() %&gt;% \n  opt_row_striping() %&gt;% \n  opt_table_lines(\"none\") %&gt;% \n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_borders(sides = c(\"top\", \"bottom\"), \n                         color = \"grey\", weight = px(1)),\n    locations = cells_column_labels(everything())\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTeam\n.pred_class\nOpponent\n.pred_L\n\n\n\n\nNorfolk State\nL\nAppalachian State\n0.5542561\n\n\nWichita State\nL\nDrake\n0.5503606\n\n\nMount St. Mary's\nW\nTexas Southern\n0.2786840\n\n\nMichigan State\nL\nUCLA\n0.5978317\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince these games have already happened, we know the outcome, and my model got 3 of 4 correct. The only miss was predicting Norfolk State would win, but it also happens to be the game the model has the least amount of confidence in.\nThis might actually work."

I’ve been as low as 10.8 millionth place, so I’ve come up a bit. I still have three of my four Final Four teams and four of eight Elite Eight teams.\nWhen the dust has settled, I’m going to come back and evaluate. Here’s screenshots of my bracket."
