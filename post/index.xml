      <description>Nebraska fans haven’t had the best time watching basketball lately. The last two seasons have featured only seven wins in each season. This season they only won three games in the Big Ten, but that was an improvement over last season when they only won two.
But anyone watching Nebraska basketball this season could see there was a difference between last season’s squad and this one. And given that the Big Ten was rated as the best conference in college basketball during the season, it begs the question: Is Nebraska that bad?</description>

      <description>I do not know a lot about college basketball. I follow the travails of my employer and a little about the Big Ten Conference as a whole, but at best it’s surface knowledge. I kinda know who is good that we’re going to play and who isn’t. Beyond that, nada.
Which is bad when it comes to tournament time.
My typical pattern of filling out bracket is Have I Heard Of This Team, Do They Have a Legendary Coach or Do I Hate Them For Some Reason.</description>

      <description>I’ve recently shifted my Sports Data Analysis and Visualization class from creating static graphics that get exported as a png graphic to creating blog posts. In doing so, the chapter on tables is not terribly useful or relevant. Exporting a visually interesting table to a png was not easy, so there’s a lot of code and content dedicated to that.
It can go away now.</description>
