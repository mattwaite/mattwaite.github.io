And they come with all the problems that both a camera and a flying object involve. The problems with cameras – the ethical issues and the privacy issues – are ones that are well worn. We’ve been talking about them since at least the Civil War. The flying parts are newer – since 1903 – but never before has a flying camera become more accessible. Before we get to the laws governing flying cameras, what could you do with one? Our answer: give people a view of something they’ve never had before, and give them the context they need to understand how big something really is. But to do that in the United States, you have to pass an FAA test. To be a knowledgeable user, you need to understand the history and the law before you put a flying robot into the skies. And to be a responsible journalist, you need to understand the ethical limitations of what you should and shouldn’t do with a drone. 1.1 The FAA Test To get an FAA Part 107 certificate, you need to first need to meet some criteria: You must be 16 years old. You must read, write and understand English. You must pass the FAA’s aeronautical knowledge test. You must pass a Department of Homeland Security background check. Three of the four, you’re on your own. This text will help with the test. The test required to become a licensed drone operator in the United States is given by the Federal Aviation Administration at one of nearly 700 certified testing facilities across the country. If this is the first time you are taking the test, it has 60 multiple-choice questions. If you are renewing your license, it has 40 multiple-choice questions. The following table comes from the FAA’s Airman Certification Standards. The notes at the end are the author’s impressions from speaking with more than 150 people who have passed the test. Certification Knowledge Exam Share Number Notes Regulations 15-25% 9-15 Expect the higher end Airspace and Requirements 15-25% 9-15 Expect the higher end Weather 11-16% 7-10 Highly variable Loading and performance 7-11% 4-7 Expect the lower end Operations 35-45% 21-27 Covers wide array of topics The recurrent test – for those who passed the certification test two years ago and need to re-certify – has only been offered for a short time, so little is known about it. The FAA says these are the topics covered.

You will not be allowed to take anything into the test other than a calculator with no memory functions. You will not be allowed to take your cell phone with you. You must bring ID to the test. The test will cost $150 to take. You can take the test again if you fail, but you will have to wait 14 days. A passing score is 70 percent. If you are taking the test for the first time, you can miss 18 questions and still pass. There is only Pass or Fail. There is no bonus for a high score. Anything above a 70 percent is for personal pride. "],
["part-48.html", "Chapter 2 Part 48 2.1 Subpart A 2.2 Subpart B 2.3 Subpart C", " Chapter 2 Part 48 A substantial portion of the test will be over Part 107. But within Part 107 are links to other parts of the Federal Aviation Regulations that you’ll have to know. The first is Part 48. One way to frame your reading, and one way you can interpret the questions the FAA will ask is like this: Who is responsible? What are they responsible for? How do they comply? What follows is a short summary of the major parts of Part 48. You should read both regulations and refer to this summary for understanding. Before you fly your drone, you have to register it. In late 2015, the FAA added Part 48 to the Federal Aviation Regulations requiring registration of drones. Registration is online and costs $5. Below are the important sections of Part 48 – you should read the whole thing – and a note after each giving you a “short version” translation of the regulatory language. 2.1 Subpart A 48.15 Requirement to register: No person may operate a small unmanned aircraft that is eligible for registration under 49 U.S.C. 44101-44103 unless one of the following criteria has been satisfied: The owner has registered and marked the aircraft in accordance with this part; The aircraft weighs 0.55 pounds or less on takeoff, including everything that is on board or otherwise attached to the aircraft; or The aircraft is an aircraft of the Armed Forces of the United States. The important notes here are that if your drone weighs more than .55 pounds, you have to register it. 48.20 Eligibility for registration: A small unmanned aircraft may be registered under 49 U.S.C. 44103 and under this part only when the aircraft is not registered under the laws of a foreign country and is - Owned by a U.S. citizen; Owned by an individual citizen of a foreign country lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the United States; Owned by a corporation not a citizen of the United States when the corporation is organized and doing business under the laws of the United States or a State within the United States, and the aircraft is based and primarily used in the United States; or An aircraft of - The United States Government; or A State, the District of Columbia, a territory or possession of the United States, or a political subdivision of a State, territory, or possession. Citizens, foreigners admitted for permanent residence in the US, corporations doing business in the US and governments must register. If you work for a company and they are paying your insurance, they should register it. Ideally, one person should be responsible for those registrations in order to track them. 48.25 Applicants: To register a small unmanned aircraft in the United States under this part, a person must provide the information required by § 48.100 to the Registry in the form and manner prescribed by the Administrator. Upon submission of this information, the FAA issues a Certificate of Aircraft Registration to that person. A small unmanned aircraft must be registered by its owner using the legal name of its owner, unless the owner is less than 13 years of age. If the owner is less than 13 years of age, then the small unmanned aircraft must be registered by a person who is at least 13 years of age. In accordance with 49 U.S.C. 44103(c), registration is not evidence of aircraft ownership in any proceeding in which ownership of an unmanned aircraft by a particular person is in issue. In this part, “owner” includes a buyer in possession, a bailee, a lessee of a small unmanned aircraft under a contract of conditional sale, and the assignee of that person. A drone must be registered to its owner, unless the owner is less than 13 years old. The reason for the cutoff? Federal privacy laws. 2.2 Subpart B 48.100 Application: Required information: Persons intending to use the small unmanned aircraft as other than a model aircraft. Each applicant for a Certificate of Aircraft Registration issued under this part must submit all of the following information to the Registry: Applicant name and, for an applicant other than an individual, the name of the authorized representative applying for a Certificate of Aircraft Registration. Applicant’s physical address and, for an applicant other than an individual, the physical address for the authorized representative. If the applicant or authorized representative does not receive mail at their physical address, a mailing address must also be provided. Applicant’s email address or, for applicants other than individuals, the email address of the authorized representative. The aircraft manufacturer and model name. The aircraft serial number, if available. Other information as required by the Administrator. Required information: Individuals intending to use the small unmanned aircraft exclusively as a model aircraft. Each applicant for a Certificate of Aircraft Registration issued under this part must submit all of the following information to the Registry: Applicant name. Applicant’s physical address and if the applicant does not receive mail at their physical address, a mailing address must also be provided. Applicant’s email address. Other information as required by the Administrator. Provision of information. The information identified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section must be submitted to the Registry through the Web-based small unmanned aircraft registration system in a form and manner prescribed by the Administrator. Issuance of Certificate of Aircraft registration. The FAA will issue a Certificate of Aircraft Registration upon completion of the application requirements provided in paragraph (a) or (b) of this section as applicable. For purposes of Part 107 – i.e. non-hobby operations – you must provide a name, mailing address, email address, aircraft manufacturer and model name, the serial number of the aircraft. Hobbyists do not have to provide the make, model and serial number. 48.105 Requirement to maintain current information: The holder of a Certificate of Aircraft Registration must ensure that the information provided under § 48.100 remains accurate. The holder of a Certificate of Aircraft Registration must update the information using the web-based small unmanned aircraft registration system within 14 calendar days of the following: A change in the information provided under § 48.100. When aircraft registration requires cancellation for any reason including sale or transfer, destruction, or export. You have 14 days to update information when it changes. 48.110 Registration: Persons intending to use small unmanned aircraft for purposes other than as model aircraft: Certificate of Aircraft Registration. A Certificate of Aircraft Registration issued in accordance with § 48.100 for aircraft used for purposes other than as model aircraft constitutes registration only for the small unmanned aircraft identified on the application. Effective date of registration. An aircraft is registered when the applicant receives a Certificate of Aircraft Registration for the specific aircraft. The effective date of registration is shown by the date of issue on the Certificate of Aircraft Registration issued for the aircraft. Registration renewal. A Certificate of Aircraft registration issued under this part expires 3 years after the date of issue unless it is renewed. The holder of a Certificate of Aircraft Registration must renew the Certificate by verifying, in a form and manner prescribed by the Administrator, that the information provided in accordance with § 48.100 of this subpart is accurate and if it is not, provide updated information. The verification may take place at any time within the six months preceding the month in which the Certificate of Aircraft registration expires. A certificate issued under this paragraph expires three years from the expiration date of the previous certificate. Other events affecting effectiveness of Certificate. Each Certificate of Aircraft Registration issued by the FAA under this subpart is effective, unless registration has ended by reason of having been revoked, canceled, expired, or the ownership is transferred, until the date upon which one of the following events occurs: Subject to the Convention on the International Recognition of Rights in Aircraft when applicable, the aircraft is registered under the laws of a foreign country. The small unmanned aircraft is totally destroyed or scrapped. The holder of the Certificate of Aircraft Registration loses U.S. citizenship. Thirty days have elapsed since the death of the holder of the Certificate of Aircraft Registration. The owner, if an individual who is not a citizen of the United States, loses status as a resident alien, unless that person becomes a citizen of the United States at the same time. The owner is a corporation other than a corporation which is a citizen of the United States and one of the following events occurs: The corporation ceases to be lawfully organized and doing business under the laws of the United States or any State thereof; or The aircraft was not operated exclusively within the United States during the period of registration under this part. The certificate is good for 3 years from the date it was issued. It can be renewed. The certificate can also expire if the aircraft is registered in a foreign country; the aircraft is destroyed or scrapped; the owner loses U.S. citizenship; 30 days have passed since the owner died; the owner loses status as a resident alien; or the corporation that registered it ceases to operate under the laws of the U.S. 48.120 Invalid Application: The registration of a small unmanned aircraft is invalid if, at the time it is made - The aircraft is registered in a foreign country; The applicant is not the owner, except when the applicant registers on behalf of an owner who is under 13 years of age; The applicant is not eligible to submit an application under this part; or The interest of the applicant in the aircraft was created by a transaction that was not entered into in good faith, but rather was made to avoid (with or without the owner’s knowledge) compliance with 49 U.S.C. 44101-44103. 2.3 Subpart C 48.205 Display and location of unique identifier: The unique identifier must be maintained in a condition that is legible. The unique identifier must be affixed to the small unmanned aircraft by any means necessary to ensure that it will remain affixed for the duration of each operation. The unique identifier must be readily accessible and visible upon inspection of the small unmanned aircraft. A unique identifier enclosed in a compartment is readily accessible if it can be accessed without the use of any tool. This doesn’t have to be art. Label makers, taped down pieces of paper – just about anything will work so long as it’s readable and doesn’t require tools to get access to it. "],
["part-107.html", "Chapter 3 Part 107 3.1 Subpart A 3.2 Subpart B 3.3 Subpart C", " Chapter 3 Part 107 A significant portion of both the certification test and the recurrent knowledge test will cover Part 107. A few of the questions will be direct knowledge – a specific operating limitation, for example. More often, you’ll need to know about a section of Part 107 in order to answer a question about something else. One way to frame your reading, and one way you can interpret the questions the FAA will ask is like this: Who is responsible? What are they responsible for? How do they comply? Like Part 48, you should read all of Part 107. Below are the important sections of Part 107 and a note after each giving you a “short version” translation of the regulatory language. 3.1 Subpart A 107.3 Definitions: You should review these. None are surprising. 107.5 Falsification, reproduction or alteration: If you falsify any information to the FAA under Part 107, you could have three things happen: Your application for a remote pilot certificate could be denied. Your existing remote pilot certificate could be revoked. You could face a civil penalty. 107.7 Inspection, testing and demonstration of compliance: A section like this exists for all pilots, but in short, it says you must produce all Part 107 or Part 48 related documents if asked. Part 107 says The Administrator but they mean any FAA designated person. Most often this will be in the form of the local Flight Standards District Office (FSDO). You must also allow The Administrator to conduct a test or inspection of the drone, the pilot in command or the visual observer. NOTE: Part 61, which governs manned aircraft pilots, also adds that you have to provide your documents to federal, state and local law enforcement. That is NOT in Part 107, but common sense tells you it would be wise to have those documents on you at all times, and that local law enforcement will be your most likely first point of contact. 107.9 Accident reporting: No later than 10 days, you must report accidents to the FAA that result in “serious injury to any person or any loss of consciousness,” or property damage exceeds $500 (to repair or replace). The damage amount does not include your drone. It’s to someone else’s property. 3.2 Subpart B 107.12 Requirement for a remote pilot certificate with a small UAS rating: This section just says you must have a remote pilot certificate if you fly for non-hobby purposes OR you must be under the direct supervision of someone who does have a certificate who can take control immediately if needed. 107.15 Condition for safe operation: No one may operate a drone under 107 that isn’t in a safe condition to operated. It is the pilot in command’s responsibility to do a pre-flight check to ensure it is safe. No flight may continue if the pilot in command has reason to believe it’s no longer safe. In short: Don’t fly if something seems wrong, and don’t continue if you notice something isn’t right. 107.17 Medical condition: If you have a medical condition that would interfere with safe operations, you can’t fly the drone. 107.19 Remote pilot in command: You must designate a pilot in command. They are the final authority and responsible party for the operation. They must ensure no undue hazard to people, aircraft or property in the event of a loss of control. The pilot also must be able to to fly the drone in compliance with Part 107. 107.21 In-flight emergency: In an in-flight emergency, a pilot in command can deviate from any Part 107 rule “to the extent necessary to meet that emergency.” If you do so, the Administrator may request a written report that you must submit. 107.23 Hazardous operation: You may not operate in a “careless or reckless manner so as to endanger the life or property of another” or drop anything from your drone that creates an undue hazard to persons or property. NOTE: Careless or reckless manner will be on the test somewhere, almost guaranteed. The FAA has been pushing this reckless operations idea for years now. 107.25 Operations from a moving vehicle or aircraft: You can’t operate from a moving aircraft. You CAN operate from a moving car or boat IF you are in a sparsely populated area and not transporting property for hire. So from a boat in the open? Fine. From a tractor in a field? Fine. From a helicopter in flight? Nope. And you can’t deliver a sandwich (or anything not yours) doing it. 107.27 Alcohol or drugs: Must comply with 14CFR Part 91.17 and 91.19. The important parts: ALCOHOL: 8 hours bottle to throttle is how all pilots remember it. It regularly appears on the pilot’s knowledge exam. If you’ve had alcohol within the previous 8 hours, or are under the influence of alcohol or using drugs (prescription or otherwise) that may affect your faculties, you may not fly. If the FAA believes you flew drunk or on drugs, you must provide results of a test taken within 4 hours of acting or attempting to act as the pilot in command. 91.19 says you may not transport illegal drugs with your drone, unless you are a law enforcement officer (in case you were wondering). 107.29 Daylight operation: No night operations. You can operate in civil twilight with anti-collision lighting “visible for at least 3 statute miles”. Civil twilight is 30 minutes before official sunrise or 30 minutes after official sunset (except in Alaska). 107.31 Visual line of sight operations: The pilot in command and the visual observer must be able to see the device unaided to 1) know the aircraft’s location 2) determine altitude, attitude, direction of flight 3) observe the airspace for other air traffic or hazards 4) determine the aircraft is not endangering life or property. 107.33 Visual observer: You are not required to use a visual observer. But if you do, they must 1) maintain effective communication with each other at all times 2) be able to see the aircraft at all times. Their job is to help scan the airspace for any potential collision hazard and to maintain awareness of the position of the aircraft. 107.35 Operation of multiple small unmanned aircraft: Can’t do it. One pilot, one aircraft. 107.36 Carriage of hazardous materials: Can’t do it. 107.37 Operation near aircraft, right-of-way rules: The drone gives way to the manned aircraft always. You may not operate so close to an aircraft to create a collision hazard. 107.39 Operation over human beings: No operations over people unless they are directly participating in the operation of the craft (i.e. pilot or observer) or they are under a covered structure or inside a stationary vehicle that can provide reasonable protection. 107.41 Operations in certain airspace: No operation in Class B, C or D or E airspace without ATC authorization. 107.43 Operation in the vicinity of airports: You may not interfere with operations and traffic patterns at any airport, heliport or seaplane base. 107.45 Operation in prohibited or restricted areas: Can’t do it unless you have permission of the controlling agency. 107.47 Flight restrictions in the proximity of certain areas designated by notice to airmen: You must comply with 91.137 through 91.145 and 99.7. Let’s split this up: 99.7 Special security instructions: It says if you fly in an air defense identified zone, you have to comply with instructions from both the military and the FAA to protect national security. 91.137-91.145 Temporary flight restrictions: The summary of these sections are that if a NOTAM has been issued restricting flight in an area, you may not fly there unless you get permission from ATC and comply with a list of rules that is going to make it very hard for drones to get permission. 91.137 is about natural disasters. It allows flights in support of hazard operations, Instrument Flight Rules flight plans, which drones can’t do, or is carrying “properly accredited” news representatives and a flight plan has been filed with the appropriate FAA or ATC facility specified in the NOTAM. 91.138 only deals with disasters in Hawaii. It’s identical to 91.137 except that the NOTAM can be cancelled at the request of the Hawaiian government. 91.140 just establishes that the FAA will use NOTAMs to control airspace if needed. 91.141 says no flying near the president or vice president, and there is no ATC permission here. 91.143 says no flying near space flight operations. 91.144 allows the FAA to issue TFRs in unusually high barometric pressure conditions. 91.145 says the FAA will issue a NOTAM around a long list of sporting events and large air shows. You can fly there with ATC permission. 107.49 Preflight familiarization, inspection and actions for aircraft operation: First things first: This is the pilot in command’s job and responsibility. They will ask. Prior to the flight, the PIC must: Assess the operating environment to ensure it’s safe, to include weather, airspace, TFRs, where people or property are and other ground hazards. Brief everyone about the operations, conditions, emergency procedures, contingency plans, roles, responsibilities and potential hazards. Ensure control linkages between ground and aircraft work. Ensure there’s enough battery power for the proposed flight Ensure anything attached to the drone is secure and doesn’t affect the controls. 107.51 Operating limitations for small unmanned aircraft: These are easy to summarize: Can’t go faster than 87 knots/100 miles per hour. 400 feet is the maximum altitude UNLESS you are flying within 400 feet of a building and you don’t fly higher than 400 feet of the top of the building. Manned pilots have to remain 1,000 feet from tall structures or must be 500 feet above the structure. 3 statute miles of visibility at your location. 500 feet below clouds. So a cloud ceiling of 700 feet will limit your maximum altitude to 200 feet. 2,000 feet horizontally from clouds. 3.3 Subpart C 107.57 Offenses involving alcohol or drugs: A drug conviction is grounds for denying, suspending or revoking your remote pilot certificate. 107.59 Refusal to submit to an alcohol test or furnish test results: Grounds for denying, suspending or revoking your remote pilot certificate. 107.61 Eligibility: To get a remote pilot certificate with small UAS rating, you must: Be at least 16, be able to read, speak, write and understand English, not have a mental or physical condition that would affect your ability to fly safe, and be able to pass the Part 107 test. 107.63 Issuance of a remote pilot certificate with a small UAS rating: You have to apply, online or on paper. You must include evidence that you passed the test. Your test center will help you with this. 107.64 Temporary Certificate: A temporary certificate will be issued that’s valid for 120 days or until a permanent certificate will be issued by the FAA. 107.65 Aeronautical knowledge recency: You’ll have to take a recurrent knowledge test every 24 months after you pass the initial test. 107.67 Knowledge test: general procedures and passing grades: Bring proper ID – a driver’s license works – that has a photo, a signature, a DOB and a permanent mailing address. Passing score is a 70 percent, but that is not specified in Part 107. 107.69 Knowledge tests: Cheating or other unauthorized conduct: Don’t cheat. Read the rest for details. 107.71 Retesting after failure: You can retake the test if you fail, but not for 14 days. 107.73 Initial and recurrent knowledge tests: The subjects covered are: Regulations covering small unmanned system rating privileges, limitations and flight operation Airspace, operating requirements and flight restrictions for UAS Aviation weather sources and effects on weather on small unmanned aircraft performance Small unmanned aircraft loading Emergency procedures Crew resource management Radio communications procedures Determining performance of small unmanned aircraft Physiological effects of drugs and alcohol Aeronautical decision-making and judgment Airport operations Maintenance and pre-flight procedures 107.200 Waivers: You can request a waiver from these rules and if the FAA determines you can do it safely, they can grant it. But you can only deviate how they authorize and you must follow it. 107.205 List of regulations subject to waiver: 107.25 operations from a moving vehicle; 107.29 Daylight operations; 107.31 Visual line of sight aircraft operation; 107.33 Visual observer; 107.35 Operation of multiple small unmanned aircraft systems; 107.37(a) Yielding the right of way; 107.39 operation over people; 107.41 operation in certain airspace; 107.51 operating limitations for small unmanned aircraft.

["airspace.html", "Chapter 4 Airspace 4.1 Reading a sectional chart 4.2 The AFD 4.3 Airspace Operational Requirements 4.4 ATC clearances 4.5 Common aircraft accident causal factors 4.6 NOTAMS", " Chapter 4 Airspace Read Chapter 15 in the Pilot’s Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge The National Airspace System is divided into slices that are described as an upside-down birthday cake. In each place, the rules are different. You must know how to identify what airspace you are flying in prior to going to the site to determine what is required of you. Notes There are two kinds of altitude: AGL and MSL – Above Ground Level and Mean Sea Level. In aviation, both are used. You need to know when. On a sectional chart, MSL is used. For drone operations, AGL is used. To translate MSL to AGL, you need to know the elevation you are at. Most of the time, the nearest airport will suffice. The airport elevation is in the Airport Facilities Directory, which we will discuss soon. So, for example, Class C airspace in Lincoln is controlled from the surface to 5,200 MSL. The Lincoln airport elevation is 1,200 feet above sea level. So Class C airspace extends from the surface to 4,000 feet AGL, or 3,600 feet higher than you can fly legally. Class A airspace starts at 18,000 MSL. You do not need to know about Class A airspace, other than to know it exists and you can not fly in it. Class B airspace surrounds the busiest airports in the country. Think Atlanta, Chicago, New York, Washington DC, Dallas, LA, San Francisco. If you change planes at that airport, it’s likely a Class B airport. For drone operators, the Class B airspace that governs operators extends 5 miles from the Class B designated airport. For aircraft pilots, the Class B designation extends 30 nautical miles from the airport above 10,000 feet, and requires special training to enter and permission from Air Traffic Control (ATC) to enter. Class C airspace surrounds the next level of airport. Think of places like Omaha and Des Moines – places with commercial jet traffic but not busy hubs. The surface control zone that includes drone operators extends 5 miles from the airport in all directions. Outside of 5 miles, the Class C control zone extends to 10 miles from the airport above 1500 feet AGL, which is 1000 feet higher than an operator is allowed to fly legally. Class D airspace generally extends less than 5 miles from the airport up to 2,500 feet AGL, and is reserved for airports with a partially operating control tower or no operating control tower. Class E airspace is airspace that is either overlying Class G (or uncontrolled) airspace above 700 AGL or 1200 AGL, or airspace above an airport that has no tower but does have an instrument approach procedure for manned aircraft. Class G airspace is the airspace we will most often work in. In areas near airports but not in surface control zones, Class G airspace extends to 700 feet AGL, which encompasses all of the 400 feet AGL drone operators can fly in. If the airspace is outside of 5 miles from an airport, and it is not designated with a restriction for some other reason, it is Class G airspace in the places where drone operators can fly. 4.1 Reading a sectional chart Note: Class C (Charlie) is broken up into two segments - 5 miles from the tower (inner ring) and 10 miles from the tower (outer ring). Reading the sectional: Class B = solid blue Class C = solid purple Class D = dotted blue Class E = dotted purple Class G = fuzzy purple Other airspaces: Prohibited areas. No flights are allowed, generally for national security reasons. Restricted areas. Flight is not prohibited, but requires additional levels of permissions to fly there. Generally they are areas where the military conducts exercises hazardous to aircraft. Military operations areas. MOAs are designated on the sectional chart with purple hashing, and again on the back of the sectional. MOAs are only active during certain times, and those times are designated on the sectional. Also included is the controlling agency in which to ask for permission. Alert areas. Must be vigilant. Military Training Routes. Denoted on a sectional chart as IRXXXX and VRXXXX. They are routes where the military conducts training flights at lower altitudes and at high speeds. If the route is all below 1500 feet AGL, the route will have a four-digit number, ex. VR1205. If one or more of the segments are above 1500 feet AGL, it will have three digits, ex. VR207. What do they mean? They mean extra vigilance. You can fly there, but you have to be extra cautious. Things you will be tested on: If I want to fly in X place, what airspace am I in? What restrictions do I have? What are the restrictions or responsibilities if I am near a symbol on the map? 4.2 The AFD The FAA publishes a book of information about each and every airport in the United States. It’s called the AFD – the Airport Facilities Directory. [The digital version is here] (https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/flight_info/aeronav/digital_products/dafd/search/). Airports are found through their formal airport code designation, and most will begin with the letter K. Lincoln, for example, is KLNK. Omaha is KOMA. 4.3 Airspace Operational Requirements Basic weather minimums Each airspace classification has a set of weather minimums that manned pilots must comply with. UAS pilots, under Part 107, have a much more simplified weather minimums: 3 statute miles or greater visibility Minimum cloud distances: 500 feet below, 2,000 feet laterally. In certain airspaces, manned aircraft can fly with lower visibility levels. You can not. These are the only weather minimums listed in Part 107. Practically speaking, wind, temperature and precipitation will have a significant impact on your operations. You should refer to your manufacturer’s manual or the Drone Journalism Lab Operations Manual for more information. 4.4 ATC clearances To fly in controlled airspace, you need to get permission from ATC. How this will be done isn’t set in Part 107, and will for a period of time be individual to the FSDO and ATC facility. You would be wise to make contact as a collective in your community and work out issues around short notice approvals (like breaking news). In Advisory Circular (AC) 107-2, the FAA says this about ATC clearances: Though many sUAS operations will occur in uncontrolled airspace, there are some that may need to operate in controlled airspace. Operations in Class B, Class C, or Class D airspace, or within the lateral boundaries of the surface area of Class E airspace designated for an airport, are not allowed unless that person has prior authorization from air traffic control (ATC). The link to the current authorization process can be found at www.faa.gov/uas/. The sUAS remote PIC must understand airspace classifications and requirements. Failure to do so would be in violation of the Part 107 regulations and may potentially have an adverse safety effect. Although sUAS will not be subject to Part 91, the equipage and communications requirements outlined in Part 91 were designed to provide safety and efficiency in controlled airspace. Accordingly, while sUAS operating under Part 107 are not subject to Part 91, as a practical matter, ATC authorization or clearance may depend on operational parameters similar to those found in part 91. The FAA has the authority to approve or deny aircraft operations based on traffic density, controller workload, communication issues, or any other type of operations that could potentially impact the safe and expeditious flow of air traffic in that airspace. Those planning sUAS operations in controlled airspace are encouraged to contact the FAA as early as possible. (For suggested references, please see paragraph 2.3.) And later: Air Traffic Organization (ATO). The ATO does not have the authority to deny sUAS operations on the basis of equipage that exceeds the Part 107 requirements. Because additional equipage and technologies, such as geo-fencing, have not been certificated by the FAA, they need to be examined on a case-by-case basis in order for the FAA to determine their reliability and functionality. Additionally, requiring ATC to review equipage would place a burden on ATC and detract from other duties. Instead, a remote pilot who wishes to operate in controlled airspace because he or she can demonstrate mitigations through equipage may do so by applying for a waiver (see paragraph 5.19). Paragraph 5.19 says that if you need a waiver from Part 107 requirements, such as flying in controlled airspace, you need to apply at www.faa.gov/uas/. This route will work for non-breaking news situations. 4.4.1 Maximum altitude limit Under Part 107, all UAS flights must stay at or below 400 feet AGL. Under certain circumstances, ATC may require a lower ceiling to ensure safety. 4.4.2 Operations near airports Part 107 is clear that you may not interfere with airport operations. In AC 107, the FAA elaborates: In order to avoid interfering with operations in a traffic pattern, remote PICs should avoid operating in the traffic pattern or published approach corridors used by manned aircraft. When operational necessity requires the remote PIC to operate at an airport in uncontrolled airspace, the remote PIC should operate the small UA in such a way that the manned aircraft pilot does not need to alter his or her flightpath in the traffic pattern or on a published instrument approach in order to avoid a potential collision. Because remote PICs have an obligation to yield right-of-way to all other aircraft and avoid interfering in traffic pattern operations, the FAA expects that most remote PICs will avoid operating in the vicinity of airports because their aircraft generally do not require airport infrastructure, and the concentration of other aircraft increases in the vicinity of airports. 4.5 Common aircraft accident causal factors Read chapter 7 of the Aeronautical Information Manual These are the top 10 causes of accidents in manned flight. Most of them will be applicable to unmanned aircraft. Inadequate preflight preparation and/or planning Failure to obtain and/or maintain flying speed Failure to maintain direction control Improper level off Failure to see and avoid objects or obstructions Mismanagement of fuel Improper in-flight decisions or planning Misjudgment of distance and speed Selection of unsuitable terrain Improper operation of of flight controls. 4.5.1 Laser operations and reporting illuminating aircraft The FAA, for years, has received reports of people aiming lasers at aircraft. In the AIM, it says these lasers can temporarily blind manned aircraft pilots, creating a major hazard to flight, which is not allowed. All pilots, UAS or otherwise, are asked to report any laser illumination of aircraft to the nearest ATC facility. 4.5.2 Miscellaneous hazards Avoid flight beneath unmanned balloons. They often have tethers or hard-to-see wiring beneath them. Avoid flying near thermal plumes such as smoke stacks and cooling towers. The unstable and rapidly rising air will make control difficult and greatly increase the risk of a crash. Flying near wires requires a substantial degree of caution and risk awareness. Wires can be difficult to impossible to see, so great care must be taken when flying near radio towers or high capacity electrical lines. Precipitation static can occur when aircraft come in contact with precipitation that is uncharged. The result is a significant negative charge can build up, which will discharge into something called a “cornona.” The coronoa will discharge the energy out of the aircraft’s extremities, and will cause massive disruption to the aircraft’s electrical systems. This is highly unlikely to occur on small UAS, especially those with plastic shells, and especially those that are not weatherized. 4.6 NOTAMS A NOTAM is a Notice To Airmen that alerts a pilot to something that could affect flight. Most often, they are issues with airport equipment, which will not affect you. But you need to check them to make sure it is safe to fly. NOTAMs can be found through a web interface, through various commercial apps and through a Flight Services briefing, either by phone or online. "],
["weather.html", "Chapter 5 Weather 5.1 Weather theory 5.2 Cloud ceilings and visibility 5.3 Aviation weather sources", " Chapter 5 Weather Read Chapter 12 in the Pilot’s Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge. It’s good, and it will be one of the largest areas tested. Weather for drones is pretty simple: Precipitation: If it’s wet out, you don’t fly. Period. These devices aren’t waterproof and water will kill them. Snow, rain, sleet, etc. is a no go. Temperature: If it’s bitter cold out, you will ruin your batteries. You might still fly if it’s worth torching $75-$150 batteries, but understand anything below 50 degrees will degrade battery performance and flight time. Visibility: Part 107, you are limited to flights in VFR conditions: 3 miles of visibility, 500 feet below and 2,000 feet laterally from clouds. So how do you determine if there is 3 miles of visibility? Be smart. If you look outside and it’s foggy, you do not have 3 miles of visibility. Check visibility at the nearest airport at aviationweather.gov &lt;http://aviationweather.gov/&gt;_ Click METAR and search for the airport code of the nearest airport. Look for a prominent landmark near you that you can either map or estimate the distance to it. 5.1 Weather theory Weather is the result of the uneven heating of the planet, which creates air of different temperatures and air pressures. The interaction of these things is what makes weather. Chapter 12 of the Pilot’s Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge covers this in-depth and it’s very much worth reading. We will cover the parts of weather specifically mentioned by the airman certification standards. 5.1.1 Density altitude There are multiple concepts to understand here: Atmospheric pressure: The force the air exerts. As altitude increases, air pressure decreases. Standard pressure, at sea level is 29.92 millibars of mercury. Pressure at altitude is adjusted to be on the same scale as sea level pressure for altimeters. For drones, this isn’t an issue. Density altitude: The altitude of your aircraft adjusted for non-standard temperature and pressure. As you go up, the air gets thinner. With less air to work with, aircraft performance is affected. Airplanes need longer distances to take off. Propellers become less effective. As pressure decreases, there is a pronounced effect on performance. 5.1.2 Wind and currents, air masses and fronts General information: Air flows from high pressure to low. High pressure systems are usually dry, stable descending air masses. Low pressure systems tend to be unstable and brings clouds and precipitation. Convective currents: In warm weather, different surfaces radiate heat at different rates. This can cause air to rise at different rates, which creates updrafts. In warm weather at low altitudes, you can expect turbulence because of that rising air. Low-level wind shear: Wind shear is a sudden, drastic change in wind speed or direction. Wind shear can subject aircraft to violent changes in altitude and attitude. Most often associated with passing frontal systems, thunderstorms and temperature inversions with strong upper level winds. 5.1.3 Stability Stability of the air depends on its ability to resist vertical motion. Rising air is unstable. Some impacts on stability: Inversion: When air rises, it expands and cools. But sometimes, the temperature rises with altitude. That’s an inversion. It’s usually a shallow layer of smooth stable air close to the ground. If the humidity of the air below the inversion layer is high, it could lead clouds, fog, haze or smoke diminishing visibility. 5.1.4 Temperature and humidity Temperature and humidity has an impact on aircraft performance. Warm humid air decreases aircraft performance – water vapor is lighter than air, which makes it rise. 5.1.5 Thunderstorms, microbursts, tornadoes For thunderstorms to form, there needs to be sufficient water vapor, unstable air, and a lifting force to start the storm process. Typically that’s when a high and low pressure system collide, with sufficient water vapor, storms occur along the front. It can also happen in hot, humid weather, where the heat provides the lifting force and creates short duration, small area storms. Storms present all manner of hazards to aviation. Winds, precipitation, turbulence, wind shear. The answer is never fly in or near thunderstorms. Tornadoes are storms that draw air into them with a circulating force so a vortex forms. If a forecast predicts tornadoes, that will be an especially hazardous storm for all aircraft, manned or unmanned. 5.1.6 Icing and hail Icing occurs when water is carried above the freezing mark in the atmosphere. Pilots should be alert for icing any time the temperature approaches freezing and visible moisture is present. Hail competes with turbulence as the greatest thunderstorm hazard to aircraft. Hail forms when water is carried high enough to freeze, and then other water droplets begin to freeze to it and it begins to fall. As it falls, it melts, so rain at the surface does not mean there is no hail aloft. Hail stones, suffice it to say, are death to small UAS. 5.1.7 Fog Fog is a cloud that begins within 50 feet of the surface. It typically occurs when the temperature of the air near the surface is cooled to the air’s dew point, which causes the water vapor to condense and become visible. There are other types of fog that can form: radiation fog occurs on clear nights with little to no wind present. The ground cools quickly because of radiational cooling and the surrounding air reaches the dew point. It typically occurs in mountain valleys and low lying areas. Advection fog is where warm moist air moves over a cool surface. Wind is required. Upslope fog occurs when moist stable air is force up a slope, like a mountain. Steam fog occurs when cold dry air moves over warm water. 5.1.8 Lightning The main hazard of lightning for drone operations is that it can temporarily blind the pilot. Obviously, a lightning strike would be fatal to a drone. And lightning is a hazard of thunderstorms. Flight with lightning nearby is not advised. 5.2 Cloud ceilings and visibility With clouds, there are various levels of intensity: CLR or clear = less than 1/8 FEW or few 1/8 - 2/8 SCT or scattered 3/8 - 4/8 BKN or broken 5/8 - 7/8 OVC or overcast 8/8. A cloud ceiling is the lowest layer of clouds reported as broken or overcast. The cloud ceiling is reported in AGL. So a cloud ceiling report of BKN at 700 would be broken at 700 feet AGL. Since drones have to be 500 feet from clouds, that would limit your ceiling to 200 feet AGL. Visibility is the greatest horizontal distance at which prominent objects can be seen with the naked eye. It is reported in statute miles. 5.3 Aviation weather sources Chapter 13 of the Pilot’s Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge goes into detail on all of the services available. You should especially study the differences between a standard briefing, an abbreviated briefing and an outlook briefing. The most commonly used weather report is the METAR (Aviation Routine Weather Report) and the TAF (Terminal Area Forecast). 5.3.1 Decoding METAR This is a METAR report that you’ll have to decode. KLNK 151754Z 23006KT 10SM CLR 06/01 A2983 RMK AO2 SLP109 I6000 T00560006 10056 21044 58015 Decoding KLNK 151754Z: This is raw METAR output for KLNK. It’s for the 15th of the month, at 1745 ZULU time, which is six hours ahead of US Central Standard Time. It drops to five with Daylight Savings Time. Decoding 23006KT: Winds are at 230 degrees at 6 knots. South is 180. North is 0. East is 090, west is 270. So the winds are out of the southwest at 6 knots. Decoding 10SM CLR: This is the visibility. In this case, it’s 10 Statute Miles Clear. If there are clouds, it will note it here. Instead of CLR, it’ll give the cloud ceilings. In Omaha right now, the visibility report says 10SM FEW250 – meaning there are a few clouds at 25,000 feet. If it said FEW008 it would mean there were clouds at 800 feet, and you’d have to fly no higher than 300 feet to maintain 500 feet of clearance from clouds. Decoding 06/01: This is the temperature and dew point in Celsius. 6 degrees C with a dew point of 1 degree C. That’s about 43 degrees F. To be totally safe with the batteries, the temperature should be 10 C, or 50 F. Wind: The aircraft you are using are going to be between 3 and 6 pounds, which means winds will factor in greatly. The maximum winds these devices can be expected to even function in is 20 knots (about 25 miles per hour). The Drone Journalism Lab Safety Manual caps operations at 15. If the winds are in excess of 15 knots, control will be too unpredictable and minimum safety levels can’t be guaranteed. If safety is ever questioned, we scrub the flight. NOTE: If the visibility report includes SH (showers), TS (thunderstorms), FZ (freezing) or DZ (drizzle), RA (rain), SN (snow) or about anything else, it means there is weather at the airport and that pretty much scrubs the flight. Remember: Wet = Drone death. 5.3.2 ASOS/AWOS Stands for Automate Surface Observing System or Automated Weather Observing System. Very similar to a METAR. Is online at https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/weather/asos/ NOTE: Study the PHAK on Weather Charts as well. "],
["aircraft-weight-and-performance.html", "Chapter 6 Aircraft weight and performance 6.1 Load Factors 6.2 Basic aircraft equipment: Inside out 6.3 Weight and balance 6.4 Aircraft performance", " Chapter 6 Aircraft weight and performance Read Chapter 5 in the Pilot’s Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge There are four forces in flight: Lift, weight, thrust and drag. These forces are the same for fixed wings as with multi-rotors. The difference is lift: On a fixed wing aircraft, air moving around the wing creates lift – called Bernoulli’s Principle – where a multi-rotor aircraft generates the lift from power. TO BE CLEAR WITH MULTI-ROTORS: NO POWER = NO LIFT = YOU CRASH. This is why monitoring battery and ensuring you have a reserve is so vitally important. Power is the only thing keeping a multi-rotor in the air. Of the four forces: Lift is achieved by all blades spinning fast enough for the upward force, created by forcing air down, to overcome the weight. When hovering, the upward force and the downward pull of the weight are at equilibrium. Thrust is achieved through changing the angle of the lift by changing the speed of some of the propellers. To go forward, the aircraft will tilt the leading edges of the aircraft down, changing the angle of the thrust. DOING SO CHANGES THE LIFT. Pitching the aircraft forward without an increase in thrust will cause the aircraft to descend. Weight is the combined weight of the aircraft and the payload, along with gravity acting upon it. Each aircraft is designed to carry a maximum payload, based on the size of the rotors and power to the engines. The more weight you carry, the more thrust you need to stay aloft. The more thrust needed to stay aloft, the more power is consumed. The more power consumed, the less flight time. Drag is a combination of the aerodynamics of the aircraft – how air moves over the surfaces of the aircraft – and the amount of air moving across the aircraft. The amount of air moving across the aircraft is a combination of the forward speed of the aircraft and the wind present in the environment. On a calm day, the aircraft will generally have a maximum of 20 minutes of flight time per battery. With a 25 percent reserve, that’s about 16 minutes of effective flight time. Any wind will negatively affect the amount of power used. Aggressive, high speed maneuvers will negatively affect the amount of power used. A strong wind can halve the amount of battery life, and therefore the flight time. 6.1 Load Factors Load factor is the ratio of the maximum load an aircraft can sustain to the gross weight of the aircraft. For example, a load factor of 3 means the total load on the aircraft is three times the gross weight of the aircraft. Any change from straight and level flight imposes load on the aircraft. The more severe the maneuver, the more severe the load factor. Steep turns are where load factors occur most, and mostly this is a fixed wing aircraft issue. Between 30 degrees of bank and 60 degrees of bank, the load doubles, from 1 (the force of gravity) to 2. From 30 degrees of bank to 80 degrees of bank, the load factor goes from 2 to 6 – an exponential increase. That load primarily rests on the wings. Exceeding the load factor on your UAS will cause damage. 6.2 Basic aircraft equipment: Inside out Frame: The structure of the aircraft. For example, the DJI products have two parts to the frame: The external shell and the internal structure. The Phantom has a more significant external shell than the Inspire 1. The Inspire’s internal structures aren’t internal. Radio receiver: Receives commands from the controller and sends them to the control board. Control board: This is the internal computer brain that controls the autopilot, provides automated flight controls and translates the inputs from the controller into movement. The control boards on the two aircraft have gyroscopes, accelerometers and GPS chips providing them information constantly that help control the aircraft while in the air. Battery: The sole source of power for all components. The battery is also the largest single source of weight on the aircraft. Power distribution board: A simple circuit board that connects the ESCs to the battery. Electronic Speed Controller: The ESC converts DC power from the battery to AC power to the motors. The ESC receives instruction from the control board to change the amount of power sent to the motor, which controls the thrust. Motor: Creates force to spin the propellers. Propeller: Directly connected to the motor. When spun, it creates thrust that is directly proportional to the speed of the spin. Each propeller spins opposite of the propeller counter to it in order to keep the multi-rotor from itself spinning. Payload: The generic term for the stuff the aircraft carries. Each aircraft will be different. For example, most UAS will have an external payload of a camera and a gimbal. 6.3 Weight and balance Read Chapter 10 in the Pilot’s Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge With drones being as small as they are, any change to the load on the aircraft is going to have a negative impact on the performance. Depending on if it’s a fixed wing or a multi rotor, the effects could be: Higher takeoff speed/greater power required for liftoff Longer takeoff run Reduced climbing ability Shorter range Reduced maneuverability Reduced stability Reduced control The main concern – and a likely test question – is the Center of Gravity, or CG. Primarily, CG calculations are mostly concerned with fixed wing aircraft, though it can be applied to multi rotors, and is concerned with the position of the CG fore and aft on the longitudinal axis (the length from the nose to the tail). If your CG is too far aft, the nose of the aircraft will lift up, making it difficult to control and creating a substantial stall risk. If your CG is too far forward, the nose will point down, making climbing difficult. Lateral balance is also important – it will cause one side or another. CG limits – the fore and aft limits of where the center of gravity can reside – are determined by the manufacturer. Rarely do small drone manufacturers provide this, so it is incumbent upon the pilot in command, after any change in load, to test the aircraft and its flight characteristics in a safe location before attempting any mission. Suffice it to say – on a small aircraft such as a small UAS, the CG limits are going to be measured in inches/centimeters, and the weights that could substantially alter the flight characteristics measured in ounces/grams. It will not take much to substantially alter the controls of your drone, so be careful. The key idea here is that the center of gravity, balance and weight information for your drone will come from your drone manufacturer. Refer to the manuals. You may be asked to calculate CG. The general formula is this: Weight X Arm = Moment Total Moment / Total Weight = CG 6.4 Aircraft performance Read Chapter 11 in the Pilot’s Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge The remote pilot certificate airman certification standards call for understanding performance charts to predict the effect on the aircraft’s performance. You should read chapter 10 and familiarize yourself with these, but no standard charts exist for UAS. It’s unclear how much you will have to know, other than performance charts exist, and things like density altitude will affect takeoff performance, and cross winds will affect the aircraft’s ability to fly straight.

["emergency-procedures.html", "Chapter 7 Emergency Procedures 7.1 Working with lithium batteries", " Chapter 7 Emergency Procedures In manned aviation, the steps you are taught in an emergency situation goes like this: Aviate, Navigate, Communicate. Aviate, meaning fly your aircraft first, follow the checklists on how to deal with a given emergency, and when you have control of the situation, then you move to the next issue: navigate. That means turn your aircraft toward the nearest airfield or begin looking for the nearest safe landing space (a field, an empty road, etc). After you have identified a safe place to attempt a landing, then you communicate with ATC alerting them to your situation. Drones are going to be similar, but the altitudes are going to be much lower, the time is going to be much shorter, and the communicating you do will likely only be with people in the immediate vicinity. The important part about dealing with an emergency is being prepared for one. Some UAS manuals will have guides on how to deal with certain emergencies. The PIC should be familiar with those before they fly. NOTE: The PIC is responsible for giving a pre-flight briefing to all involved in the flight. Part of that pre-flight briefing is going over emergency procedures. Prior to flight, the PIC should say how an emergency would be declared and what is expected of each member of the flight crew. Common types of UAS emergencies and remedies: Emergency Action Motor failure Begin immediate landing away from people, alert anyone in immediate area Power failure Alert anyone in immediate area Loss of aircraft control link Follow instructions on re-establishing, observe Return To Home engaged Loss of GPS Establish control and begin return flight to takeoff area Remember: Aviate, Navigate, Communicate. In an emergency, the PIC is responsible for the safety of those around the UAS. Their first job is to get the UAS under control (Aviate) and move it toward an optimally safe place to land (Navigate). After that, the PIC will communicate with other flight crew or warn nearby people if there is time. And remember two things from Part 107: In an emergency, you can deviate from any regulation to the extent necessary to handle the emergency safely. And if you do crash, you have to report it to the FAA if someone is significantly injured or more than $500 in property damage is done beyond your drone. If your drone crashes into an empty parking lot, you do not have to report it. 7.1 Working with lithium batteries Under the Remote Pilot Certificate Airmen Certification Standard, the FAA says you must show knowledge of the characteristics and hazards of lithium batteries, including safe use and charging, potential hazards and the risks of fires. First and foremost, follow your manufacturers guidelines for charging and using your batteries. If a battery is damaged, misshapen or excessively heats up during use or recharging, stop using it. The following comes from FAA safety alerts given to airlines that the standards reference. Each spare lithium battery must be individually protected so as to prevent short circuits (e.g., by placement in original retail packaging, by otherwise insulating terminals by taping over exposed terminals, or placing each battery in a separate plastic bag or protective pouch). Spare batteries must not come in contact with metal objects, such as coins, keys, or jewelry and take steps to prevent crushing, puncturing, or pressure on the battery. Overheating has the potential to create thermal runaway, a chain reaction leading to self-heating and release of a battery’s stored energy. Ignition of lithium metal batteries can be caused when a battery short circuits, is overcharged, is heated to extreme temperatures, is mishandled, or is otherwise defective. Once a cell is induced into thermal runaway, either by internal failure or by external means such as heating or physical damage, it generates sufficient heat to cause adjacent cells to go into thermal runaway. The result of thermal runaway in a lithium metal cell is a more severe event as compared to a lithium-ion cell in thermal runaway. The lithium metal cell releases a flammable electrolyte mixed with molten lithium metal, accompanied by a large pressure pulse. The combination of flammable electrolyte and the molten lithium metal can result in an explosive mixture. "],
["physiology.html", "Chapter 8 Physiology 8.1 Dehydration and heat stroke 8.2 Drug and alcohol use 8.3 Prescription and over-the-counter medication 8.4 Hyperventilation 8.5 Stress and fatigue 8.6 Factors affecting vision 8.7 Fitness for flight", " Chapter 8 Physiology Read Chapter 17 in the Pilot’s Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge This should be obvious: If you are on drugs, been drinking, stressed out and distracted or so tired you can barely think, don’t fly your drone. Each one of these are clear causal factors in crashes and affect your ability to safely pilot the aircraft. But the FAA wants you to know exactly how these things affect you, so here goes. Most pilots must have a valid medical certificate to fly a plane, a certificate issued by an FAA approved doctor. Drone operators DO NOT have to have a valid medical certificate. 8.1 Dehydration and heat stroke Dehydration: A critical loss of water from the body. Can be caused by heat, wind, humidity and diuretic drinks like coffee and alcohol. Common signs: headache, fatigue, cramps, sleepiness and dizziness. All will degrade performance of tasks. The solution is to make sure you’re drinking enough water for the given situation. Drone pilots are going to be outside, in the sun, heat and wind. Part of your load out kit should be sunscreen and cold water. Heat stroke: Caused when your body no longer can regulate temperature. The early signs are similar to dehydration, but can result in complete collapse. Solutions are to first ensure adequate hydration and then getting to a cool place to recover. Heat stroke is no joke. 8.2 Drug and alcohol use Alcohol: When you are flying, you are making many decisions quickly. Alcohol degrades your ability to make those decisions. It impacts your mental and physical abilities, including vision, memory, fine motor control and others. Remember the saying: Eight hours, bottle to throttle. If you have been drinking within the past eight hours, do not fly. If you are hung over, do not fly. You are still being affected by alcohol if you are hung over. Drugs: This doesn’t need to be said, but illegal drugs are bad for flying. Just say no. 8.3 Prescription and over-the-counter medication FAA regulations prohibits anyone from acting as a member of a flight crew under the influence of any medication that affects the body in any way that could affect safety. There is no public list of medications that the FAA considers to be harmful to safety. They tell you to seek out an airman medical examiner in your area and ask them. Pain relievers, like Tylenol, Advil, etc. are considered safe. Pain killers, like oxycodone, are not. Stimulants, like appetite suppressants or energy pills, can cause anxiety and mood swings and are considered dangerous for flying. Depressants, including tranquilizers, motion sickness pills and some decongestants/antihistamines, can lower blood pressure and degrade performance. Some are considered unsafe, some aren’t. If you are taking them for allergies, for instance, you need to consult an AME. 8.4 Hyperventilation Hyperventilation occurs often in response to stress, when breathing rate increases subconsciously. Rapid, shallow breathing leads to an abnormal loss of carbon dioxide from the blood. While rarely incapacitating, hyperventilation can cause visual impairment, lightheadedness or dizziness, tingling, hot or cold feelings, muscle spasm and unconsciousness. The way to deal with hyperventilation is to get your breathing back under control. The most commonly known solution is to breathe into a paper bag. If one is not around – which is often the case – speaking normally helps to regulate breathing. If the visual observer or PIC begins to show signs of hyperventilation, have them talk normally. Induce them to talk. Symptoms should subside. 8.5 Stress and fatigue Stress: When demands are placed on a person, both physical and mental, the body’s response is called the stress response. That response can include the release of hormones and increases to metabolism, heart rate, breathing, perspiration and blood sugar. Stress is divided into two types: Acute and chronic. Acute stress is an immediate threat or stressor, and most healthy people can deal with it. Chronic stress is a long-term stress that overwhelms the person’s ability to handle it. Think major life stress: death, divorce, job loss, etc. Those levels of stress can degrade performance substantially. A person suffering from chronic stress should not fly. Fatigue: Among the most common factors in pilot error. Fatigue affects attention, concentration, coordination and communication. There are two types of fatigue: mental and physical. Mental fatigue comes from prolonged stress or mentally demanding work. Physical fatigue comes lack of sleep, exercise or physically demanding work. And fatigue, like stress, falls into two categories: acute and chronic. Acute fatigue can affect timing and vision, and can be mitigated with proper sleep and diet. Chronic fatigue usually requires treatment from a doctor. Signs of chronic fatigue are long term weakness, tiredness, breathlessness, irritability and headaches. If suffering from acute or chronic fatigue, do not fly. 8.6 Factors affecting vision Vision, given that all Part 107 flights have to be within line of sight, is extremely important for safe flight. Any UAS pilot should have their eyes checked by an optometrist regularly. The PHAK describes the mechanisms in your eyes responsible for vision. The most important is that the bulk of those mechanisms are focused on the center of your vision – where you see most things – and not at the periphery. You should rely on the active vision part of your eyes more than your peripheral vision. The bulk of vision issues common to aviation happen in places or situations that won’t affect drone pilots on the ground. Fully two-thirds of the vision issues in the PHAK are night vision issues. Part 107 operations do not allow night flight. The one that could affect drone pilots is empty-field myopia. That is where pilots look without seeing. Most common in haze or in a featureless sky, empty-field myopia occurs when the pilot has nothing specific to focus on, and so begins staring at a comfortable focal distance. Given that UAS pilots must focus on their UAS, this is unlikely to occur. UAS pilots should also be looking in control sweeps across the sky looking for other traffic of a visual observer is not with them. 8.7 Fitness for flight It is the pilot in command’s responsibility to determine whether he or she is fit to fly. If the pilot is on any medication that could affect performance, or has had alcohol within 8 hours of the flight, or is experiencing any physical condition that could affect safe operations, they should decline to fly.

["aeronautical-decision-making-and-crew-resource-management.html", "Chapter 9 Aeronautical decision-making and crew resource management 9.1 Hazardous attitudes and antidotes 9.2 Risk assessment 9.3 Crew resource management and effective communication", " Chapter 9 Aeronautical decision-making and crew resource management Read Chapter 2 in the Pilot’s Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge** Aeronautical decision-making is a structured, formal approach to dealing with problems in aviation. It is meant to find the best course of action to safely accomplish the mission. It is very acronym heavy, seemingly humorous in parts, and obvious in others. The steps to ADM: Identifying hazardous attitudes Learning behavior modification Learning how to recognize and cope with stress Developing risk assessment skills Using all resources Evaluating the effectiveness of your ADM skills 9.1 Hazardous attitudes and antidotes Hazardous attitude questions will be on your test. They are on every sample test the FAA gives. Study them. The hazardous attitudes, an example and their antidotes are: Hazardous attitude Example Antidote Anti-authority “No one can tell me what to do” Follow the rules Impulsivity “Do it now” Slow down, assess the situation and act Invulnerability “It won’t happen to me” It can happen to me Macho “I can do it” I have nothing to prove to anyone Resignation “What’s the use?” I am in control 9.2 Risk assessment The most basic tool for risk assessment is a matrix. On one axis is the likelihood, on the other is the severity. Things that are likely to occur and contain a high level of severity are in the upper left corner, and unlikely things that are low risk are on the other. Risk has two parts: Identifying risks, and mitigating them. The FAA has several mnemonics to do this. 9.2.1 IMSAFE IMSAFE is a mnemonic devices to help pilots determine whether they are physically and mentally ready to fly. Illness – Sickness is an obvious risk. Medication – Are you on any medications that would increase risk? Stress – Is there anything going on in your life that will distract you from the flight? Alcohol – Have you been drinking within the past 8 hours? Are you hung over? Fatigue – Are you tired? Have you slept adequately? Eating – Are you adequately nourished for the flight? If any of these present a problem, the pilot should not fly. 9.2.2 PAVE PAVE is a pre-flight hazard identification mnemonic. Pilot in command – See IMSAFE Aircraft – Can this aircraft safely execute the flight? enVironment – Have you checked weather, terrain, airport/airspace prior to flight and will they permit a safe flight? External pressures – Are there external pressures – bosses, impressing someone, client desires – that are pushing you to act in an unsafe manner? 9.2.3 The 3P model The last part of ADM is to make decisions in the air, after the pilot has determined IMSAFE and the flight passed under PAVE. There are several models, some of which are tightly bound to the manned aircraft world. One that works in both manned and unmanned aircraft is the 3P model: Perceive, Process, Perform. Perceive the circumstances. Process by evaluating how the circumstances affect flight safety. Perform the best course of action to fly safely. 9.3 Crew resource management and effective communication According to the FAA, “CRM refers to the effective use of all available resources: human resources, hardware, and information.” CRM training is designed to ensure that crews are working together optimally. CRM primarily is about how matters are communicated among a team, how each person understands their role in the flight, and how each person does their job. “The importance of clear and unambiguous communication must be stressed in all training activities involving pilots, flight attendants, and aircraft dispatchers. The greater one’s concern in flight-related matters, the greater is the need for clear communication,” the FAA wrote in Advisory Circular 120-51e. Prior to every flight, the pilot in command must brief the crew on the flight, the goals, and inform each person what their job is while making sure they know what that is. In the briefing, emergency procedures should be discussed including actions others must take. The pilot in command is the leader and must ensure everyone has the information they need to do their job. "],
["airport-operations-and-radio-procedures.html", "Chapter 10 Airport Operations and Radio Procedures 10.1 Radio Procedures", " Chapter 10 Airport Operations and Radio Procedures Read Chapter 14 in the Pilot’s Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge Under Part 107, you are not required to communicate with ATC directly like manned aircraft must, but if you are going to operate in controlled airspace or near an airport, you may be required by ATC to be able to monitor traffic frequencies for situational awareness. There are two types of airports: Non-towered, which means there is no control tower. At non-towered airports, pilots are supposed to radio their positions over a Common Traffic Advisory Frequency (CTAF) to inform other pilots where they are, though not all do, and some forget a call or two. Towered airport, which means there is an ATC run tower at the airport and two-way communication is required with the tower to operate at the airport. Pilots will NOT call out their location in the traffic pattern at towered airports. There are also heliports and seaplane bases throughout the country marked on Sectional Charts. They are far less common than other airports. 10.0.1 Runway markings and signage Since UAS are not allowed to interfere with airport operations, and flying close enough for you to read airport markings and signage from the ground would most certainly do that, I’m not sure why the FAA says this is important for you to know. The most critical runway marking for you to learn is the number at the end of the runway. That two-digit number represents the magnetic heading of the runway. Headings are rounded to the nearest 10 and the zero is dropped from the number. So a runway 350, 10 degrees west of due north, is designated runway 35. Both ends of the runway are designated, by their heading. The other end of runway 35 would be runway 17, 10 degrees east of due south. Manned aircraft take off and land into the wind. If an airport has multiple runways, takeoff and landing will occur in the direction most favorable to headwinds. At towered airports, ATC will direct pilots to the operable runway, and the runway will be designated in ATIS broadcasts. ATIS: Automated Terminal Information Service: An automated or pre-recorded radio broadcast of important information at the airport, including winds and operating runways. Manned pilots listen to ATIS as part of pre-flight and must inform ATC that they have the latest information, designated by a phonetic alphabet letter. Ex. Information Alpha, Information Bravo, Information Charlie. AWOS: Automated Weather Observation System: Similar to ATIS, it will be a computerized recording of weather information at the airfield. It will include wind direction and speed, which will guide you toward which runway will be in use. 10.0.2 Sources for airport data Information about the airport and its traffic procedures can be found in the AFD, on Sectional Charts and through NOTAMs. The most important things you are looking for as a UAS pilot: The CTAF/UNICOM or tower frequency for traffic awareness at a non-towered airport. The CT or Control Tower frequency at a towered airport. The ATIS or AWOS frequency for information about which runway is in use and other weather information. 10.0.3 Traffic patterns Each airport will have a standard traffic pattern for landing and departing aircraft. For drone pilots flying near airports, the key is to know where to expect aircraft flying in the traffic pattern. Pattern flight is considered a critical phase of manned flight, and the pilot is managing a lot of information and executing tasks for landing and takeoff. The reason the FAA wants you to know traffic patterns is so you can see and avoid particularly vulnerable aircraft and pilots focused elsewhere. The standard traffic pattern around most airports is a rectangle of all left turns. For small manned aircraft (i.e. not jets or multi-engine aircraft), the pattern is usually contained within a mile of the airport, though ATC can and does extend different portions for traffic separation. Each leg of the rectangle is named: Departure, or upwind: The leg immediately after takeoff. The aircraft on an upwind leg will be climbing toward the traffic pattern altitude, which is normally 1,000 feet AGL. If the aircraft is going to remain in the traffic pattern, they will turn 90 degrees to the crosswind leg. If they intend to depart the pattern, they’ll exit either straight on course out of the upwind leg, or turn 45 degrees left or right of the upwind leg and depart. Crosswind: The first turn after the upwind leg, turning perpendicular to the runway. The aircraft will still be climbing on this portion but should be close to traffic pattern altitude (TPA). Downwind: The aircraft is now parallel with the runway. The downwind leg is important for two reasons: First, abeam the end of the runway, the aircraft will begin to descend. Second, aircraft entering the pattern are instructed to enter the downwind leg at at 45 degree angle abeam the midpoint of the runway. Base: The aircraft is descending perpendicular to the runway and slowing down. Final: The landing leg of the pattern. The aircraft will be at its lowest and slowest on this leg, which gives the pilot little margin to avoid obstacles. Not all airports can follow the left turn pattern. Some, with parallel runways, will orient the pattern away from the other runway – one left, one right – and include a No Transgression Zone between them that pilots cannot enter for collision avoidance. Some airports have obstacles or development on one side of the runway that prevent a safe traffic pattern over it. If the traffic pattern is non-standard, it will be noted in the AFD. 10.1 Radio Procedures Pilots at non-towered airports are required to self-announce their position at the airport on the CTAF. There’s several layers to it, but it follows a pattern. Most small aircraft will identify themselves on radio by their make and registration number. In the example from Wahoo, we used Cessna 123 Alpha Bravo, or 123AB. Some pilots will use the model name, like Skywatcher 123 Alpha Bravo. Commercial flights will identify with the airline and flight number – “United 1234”. Military aircraft most often will have a callsign. For example, the Lincoln Air National Guard KC-135 tanker planes are called “Husker Heavy [number]” on ATC Radio calls. Knowing the pattern of how the aircraft identifies itself on the radio will tell you a little about the plane, how fast it will appear near the field and how you can expect it to act once it’s near the airfield. For instance, a Skywatcher 162 Light Sport aircraft will take nearly 10 minutes from first contact with the tower to the airport pattern because it cruises between 70 and 80 miles per hour. Jets, military aircraft and fast-moving propeller aircraft will contact the tower earlier in the approach and appear much quicker because of their much greater air speed. The FAA wants you to know this in the name of improved situational awareness. 10.1.1 The phonetic alphabet ATC and pilots will use a phonetic alphabet common to military members and used in aviation around the world. Letter Phonetic pronunciation A Alpha B Bravo C Charlie D Delta E Echo F Foxtrot G Golf H Hotel I India J Juliet K Kilo L Lima M Mike N November O Oscar P Papa Q Quebec R Romeo S Sierra T Tango U Uniform V Victor W Whiskey X X-Ray Y Yankee Z Zulu 10.1.2 Airport traffic calls Pilots at non-towered airports must report their positions in the traffic pattern via radio over the CTAF or UNICOM freqency. The pattern goes like this: “[airport name] traffic, [call sign] is [position] of runway [operating runway], [airport name] traffic.” UAS pilots flying near the Wahoo, Neb. airport, a non-towered airport north of Lincoln, which is Class G airspace at the ground, could expect to hear these broadcasts on an aviation radio. “Wahoo traffic, Cessna 123 Alpha Bravo is downwind of runway Two Zero, Wahoo traffic.” “Wahoo traffic, Cessna 123 Alpha Bravo is on base for runway Two Zero, Wahoo traffic.” “Wahoo traffic, Cessna 123 Alpha Bravo is on final for runway Two Zero, Wahoo traffic.” 10.1.3 Phraseology There are three elements of phraseology that will come up not yet discussed. Many texts and many pilots will say “NINE-ER” instead of 9. Flying, I’ve heard it both ways, and my instructor rolled her eyes when I used it one day. Complex numbers are individually spelled out. 123 is One Two Three. The most common numbers you will hear are wind updates and radio frequencies. Manned pilots exiting a towered airspace are told to switch frequencies to Approach/Departure control. In Lincoln, when you depart the traffic pattern, you are told to go to Omaha Approach at “One Two Four point Zero” instead of One hundred twenty four point zero. Manned pilots in towered environments are required to read back instructions to ATC after being given and instruction. A common circumstance is for ATC to alter the pattern of an aircraft to create separating between multiple aircraft at the airfield. On the radio, you would hear “Cessna 60471, Lincoln Tower, Extend Your Downwind” and the pilot must respond “Lincoln Tower, Cessna 60471, Extending my downwind” or the tower will repeat the call with less politeness. The pattern when speaking on the radio is “Who am I calling, Who am I, What do I want”. "],
["history-and-the-law.html", "Chapter 11 History and the law 11.1 Who owns the skies? 11.2 Raphael Pirker and “aircraft” 11.3 The FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 11.4 Section 333 11.5 The Drone Journalism Lab and Drones in Education", " Chapter 11 History and the law After the Wright Brothers took off from Kitty Hawk in 1903, there was a time when there were no aviation regulations. There was no Federal Aviation Administration, no government authority telling pilots what they could and could not do. And indeed, for nearly 30 years, the federal government didn’t want the job. They insisted that regulation of the skies was a state issue. And so, every state had its own rules. Think of it like this: Imagine if every state had its own stop lights, its own speed limits and its own rules of the road. It would be a nightmare to drive anywhere, yes? That’s how it was for pilots until the Air Commerce Act of 1929, which established federal control over the skies under the Interstate Commerce Clause of the Constitution. The skies have no borders, cover the whole country and planes fly from one state to the next, therefore it’s all interstate commerce and under federal jurisdiction. So the logic goes. Aviation regulation remained part of the Commerce Department until 1956, when the Federal Aviation Agency was created in the wake of some high profile midair collisions. The agency’s charge since the beginning is to ensure safety of the skies, or what it now calls the National Airspace System (NAS). It’s worth noting here that the reason the Air Commerce Act came about is because the aviation industry asked for it – indeed pleaded for it. The nation had become a patchwork of rules that make it difficult to operate an aircraft. State legislatures had very different ideas on what they should do about aviation, and massive efforts were expended to try to unify state laws with regards to the skies, and all for naught. Since World War II, states have largely kept out of the business of flight, but have returned with a vengeance with drones. The pattern has repeated. The FAA did not have specific rules for UAS, so the states are stepping in, and it has already created a patchwork of rules that makes it difficult to operate a UAS state to state. 11.1 Who owns the skies? One area states have been active around regulating flight is in property ownership. Who owns the skies? The answer is not as simple as you would think. Since the time of the Romans, property law and the skies could be summed up with the Latin “Cuius est solum…” which was the shortened version of “Cuius est solum, eius est usque ad coelum et ad inferos”: Whoever’s is the soil, it is theirs all the way to Heaven and all the way to Hell. If you own property, you own it all the way past the moon and beyond, and all the way down to the core of the earth, under this legal maxim. And that’s how it was until 1783, when the the first man on a hot air balloon flew untethered over property in France, and lawyers around Europe immediately saw the problem. If you own the skies to the heavens, isn’t someone flying over your property trespassing? This debate raged for more than 150 years, with lawyers, legislators and people slowly and generally agreeing that the skies belonged to everyone, not just the property owner underneath them. But the idea still persists – people still believe they own all of the skies above their property. But that hasn’t been true since 1946. In World War II, the Army Air Corps went around the country buying up airstrips and turning them into training bases for bomber pilots for the war. Once such airstrip was in North Carolina next to the Causby family farm. Day and night, bombers began landing on an airstrip that came right up to the edge of their farm’s property. Planes as low as 83 feet landed over their house, waking them up at all hours and driving their chickens mad. From the filing, “low-flying military planes caused the plaintiffs’ chickens to ‘jump up against the side of the chicken house and the walls and burst themselves open and die’.” If they didn’t die, the hens stopped laying eggs. The farm went out of business and the family had to move to escape all the noise. The Causbys sued, and in 1946, the U.S. Supreme Court said Cuius est solum has no place in the modern world. But the court wrote that what happened at the Causby’s farm amounted to the government taking their property. The noise constituted a kind of trespass that made it impossible for them to enjoy their property. But Chief Justice William O. Douglas didn’t stop there. He wrote in the majority opinion that “if the landowner is to have full enjoyment of the land, he must have exclusive control of the immediate reaches of the enveloping atmosphere. Otherwise buildings could not be erected, trees could not be planted, and even fences could not be run.” In other words, the landowner “owns at least as much of the space above the ground as he can occupy or use in connection with the land.” Cuius est solum is dead, but the law says property owners still control some of their own airspace. But how much, and where, has not been determined for drones. For manned aircraft, it’s 500 feet – the minimum safe distance for a manned aircraft to fly in uncongested space. Drones are a different technology. Or are they? 11.2 Raphael Pirker and “aircraft” In 2011, Raphael “Trappy” Pirker was fined for filming a commercial for the University of Virginia with a drone. A video they posted drew a $10,000 fine for reckless operation of a UAS from the FAA. Pirker, who was part of a group of UAS pilots called Team Blacksheep who go around the world shooting videos of places, many of them unauthorized and very close to monuments or sensitive buildings. Pirker sued the FAA, challenging the notion that drones are aircraft and subject to the same regulations. Pirker, through his attorney Brendan Schulman, asserted that by the FAA’s own actions on model aircraft, there were no regulations and the only rules were voluntary guidelines established in the 1980s. If there were no rules governing drones, then the FAA had no standing to fine Pirker. At the trial court level – an administrative law court part of the National Transportation Safety Board – Pirker won. A judge agreed that drones/UAVs were not “aircraft” and subject to FAA regulations. For 22 hours, it appeared there were no rules for drones in the United States. And 22 hours after the ruling, the FAA appealed to the full NTSB, returning things to the status quo. Months later, the NTSB reversed the decision, saying that drones were indeed “aircraft” under the definition that Congress had set out: “anything designed to navigate the skies.” Pirker settled for a fraction of the original fine and dropped the case. That “aircraft” ruling set in motion a host of other regulatory changes at the FAA. 11.3 The FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 All this drone stuff you’ve been hearing about in the news? It really got started with the FAA Modernization and Reform Act (FMRA, spoken as “fim-rah”) of 2012. The big headline out of that law, at least originally, was that it settled some labor issues and disputes over subsidized routes into rural airports. But the big deal was the drones. The law ordered the FAA to safely integrate drones into the National Airspace System by September of 2015. It set out multiple interim deadlines for the FAA to meet on this route, but by September of 2015, routine drone flights were to be legal, safe and permitted. The FAA missed every deadline. Including integration. 11.4 Section 333 The real lasting news of the FMRA was Section 333. At only five paragraphs long in a 300-page bill, it wasn’t much to see. But it had the most lasting impact. Section 333 says, in whole: SEC. 333. SPECIAL RULES FOR CERTAIN UNMANNED AIRCRAFT SYSTEMS. (a) IN GENERAL. — Notwithstanding any other requirement of this subtitle, and not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Transportation shall determine if certain unmanned aircraft systems may operate safely in the national airspace system before completion of the plan and rulemaking required by section 332 of this Act or the guidance required by section 334 of this Act. ASSESSMENT OF UNMANNED AIRCRAFT SYSTEMS. — In making the determination under subsection (a), the Secretary shall determine, at a minimum— which types of unmanned aircraft systems, if any, as a result of their size, weight, speed, operational capability, proximity to airports and populated areas, and operation within visual line of sight do not create a hazard to users of the national airspace system or the public or pose a threat to national security; and whether a certificate of waiver, certificate of authorization, or airworthiness certification under section 44704 of title 49, United States Code, is required for the operation of unmanned aircraft systems identified under paragraph (1). REQUIREMENTS FOR SAFE OPERATION. — If the Secretary determines under this section that certain unmanned aircraft systems may operate safely in the national airspace system, the Secretary shall establish requirements for the safe operation of such aircraft systems in the national airspace system. The FAA missed this deadline too, but they did ultimately implement it. In it, they determined: You do NOT need an airworthiness certificate for an unmanned system. The airworthiness certificate is an intense process that can take six years for new manned aircraft designs prior to manufacture. You DO need a certificate of authorization (COA) for operating in controlled airspace. The Pilot in Command under Section 333 must be a licensed pilot. The FAA began granting exception in September 2014. The first six went to Hollywood filming companies who had already been using them for filmmaking. 11.5 The Drone Journalism Lab and Drones in Education The timeline: November 2011: The Drone Journalism Lab at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln is established. October 2012: The Drone Journalism Lab, working with the NIMBUS Lab in Computer Science and Engineering at UNL, use a drone to report a story on Nebraska’s drought. We flew in Class G airspace, over public lands, far from anyone outside of the filming of the story. This was the story we produced &lt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HV0iKlF9AdA&gt;_. July 10, 2013: We received a cease and desist order from the FAA. In the letter, the FAA said we were “operating a UAS without proper authorization.” We were unauthorized because we were a state university and had not followed the rules for government aircraft. In a follow-up phone call, we were told that as a state university, we would be under the Public Aircraft Statutes, which, prior to Section 333, was the only way to get permission from the FAA to legally use UAS for anything other than hobby flights. We began working on paperwork to get that authorization. July 3, 2014: The FAA’s lawyers, when asked by the FAA’s UAS division if universities could train drone pilots under Public Aircraft Statutes, determined that education wasn’t a government function, and that anything other than aeronautics research being done at universities counted as public aircraft. Any use by a university – for class, for research, for anything – that wasn’t aeronautics research could not be allowed under the Public Aircraft Statutes. The FAA’s UAS division begins encouraging universities to try a 333 Exemption instead of a COA. Feb. 18, 2015: The FAA rejects the Drone Journalism Lab’s COA application, saying “Your applications Program Executive Summary is not a government function under Title 49 United States Code (49 USC) section 40125(a)(2), therefore the proposed operation would not be a public aircraft operation for which the authorization is intended.” On advice from the FAA’s UAS division chief, the Drone Journalism Lab began seeking a 333 Exemption. Lab founder Matt Waite began getting his pilot’s license to comply in May 2015. He completed it on Sept. 28, 2015, the same day he applied for a Section 333 Exemption for the lab. The FAA never issued the Section 333 Exemption. Part 107 was announced in June 2016 and the FAA ceased issuing 333 exemptions in advance of the rules becoming final. Which leads us to today. Under Part 107, you can operate a drone commercially, and for education, if you can pass a 60-question multiple choice test. You need a score of 70 percent to pass. "],
["basic-operations.html", "Chapter 12 Basic Operations 12.1 General Operating Procedures", " Chapter 12 Basic Operations The number one goal of any drone journalism operation is safety. At no time should safety be compromised. If there is any doubt, return the drone, also known as an unmanned aerial system (UAS), to the landing zone and terminate the flight. Ethical journalism is responsible journalism, and flying a drone means taking responsibility for the safety of those near you, on the ground and in the air. The three flight operations roles defined in the Drone Journalism Lab Operations Manual are Pilot In Command (PIC), Observer, and Journalist. One individual can fill all three roles, which we define below: The Pilot In Command: The PIC is responsible for all flight operations. It is the PIC who has the ultimate authority on any flight. The PIC determines if the aircraft is airworthy and capable of conducting the proposed operations. The PIC is responsible for determining if the airspace allows the proposed operation. The PIC is responsible for conducting operations within all FAA regulations and any restrictions set forth by a grant of exemption. The PIC is responsible for briefing the other members of the flight crew about what the mission is, what their roles and responsibilities are, and what is expected of them before, during and after flight operations. The pilot in command, the one holding the FAA issued Part 107 certificate, is by regulation the final authority on if the aircraft flies or not. If an accident occurs, it is the Part 107 certificate holder who will be held responsible. As such, news managers must accept the pilot in command’s decision about flight safety as final. The Observer: The Observer is responsible for monitoring the operational area to ensure that there are no hazards that may endanger the flight or people not part of the UAS flight operations team. The Observer is the only member of the team who can speak to the PIC during flight operations. The Observer is to alert the PIC immediately if any aircraft come into the area, or if any person or vehicle comes near the operation. The Observer must remain within speaking distance of the PIC. Do not use radios to communicate. The Journalist: The Journalist is responsible for communicating flight goals to the PIC before flight and verifying results after landing. The Journalist determines what is needed for the story and communicates that to the PIC. The PIC is responsible for determining if the Journalist’s goals are possible under the conditions presented. During flight, the PIC may ask for feedback from the Journalist, but the Journalist should only speak to the pilot if asked while the aircraft is aloft. The Journalist can act as Observer. Under Part 107, operations can occur with only a PIC. If no additional personnel are available for the flight, care and consideration must be taken for the additional workload that the PIC will take on, including having to watch the operation area for hazards, completing journalistic goals and ensuring flight safety. The greater the number of environmental variables (bystanders, structures, trees, wind, etc.) in an operating environment, the more substantial the demands are on the PIC. 12.1 General Operating Procedures A professional UAS operation is one that involves careful planning and forethought. Before embarking on using drones to do journalism, pilots and organizations should take several steps. First and foremost, the pilot should practice with the drone to be used. Your first flight with the drone should not be for a story. Familiarization with the platform is essential. News organizations wanting to use drones should speak with local police and fire departments well before news breaks, alerting them of future news-gathering using drones. The general operating procedures for drone flights are divided into sections: Pre-trip, Pre-flight, Flight, and Post-flight. The general requirements in each are encapsulated in checklists designed to help ensure each step is accomplished. The sections, and the reasoning behind them, are described here: 12.1.1 Pre-Trip Prior to embarking on any drone operation, the pilot in command must gather information about the proposed flight area to ensure safe operations that comply with Federal Aviation Regulations. 12.1.1.1 Location Questions the PIC must answer about the location are: What is there? Are there hazards to aviation? What airspace is it in? Do you need permission from air traffic control (ATC)? Are you flying on or over private property? Do you have permission of the landowner to operate there? How many people can you expect around the area? What is your plan to prevent flight over people? Have you pulled publicly available aerial images of the area or conducted a site survey? What will the weather be? Have you consulted an aviation weather forecast? Or if the trip is immediate, have you consulted local weather sources, such as an aviation weather report (METAR), or obtained a flight briefing from Flight Services? Are your weather parameters within Part 107 minimums? Are wind levels below the operational maximums set by the manufacturer or by your own operational guidelines? What’s the altitude of the location? How might it affect your UAS and payload during flight? Have you factored in the effects of temperature on the batteries? 12.1.1.2 Defining Operational Goals Before bringing a UAS into an environment, operational personnel should define the goals of the UAS flight before leaving for the location. Be specific. What shots do you need? What purpose is the drone serving in your story? What context is the drone adding to your story? How much drone video or photography do you need to tell the story? What privacy issues can you anticipate and what steps have you taken to mitigate them? What ethical issues can you anticipate and what steps have you taken to mitigate them? 12.1.1.3 Logistics Before leaving for the operational area, consider what equipment you will need, and check the status of your equipment. When do you need to be at the location? How much travel time is involved? Have you built in time for a walkthrough of the location to note any hazards only visible on site? Do you have sufficient batteries to accomplish the task? Are they charged? 12.1.1.4 Briefing The PIC is responsible for briefing all operations personnel on each phase of flight. The PIC will designate the observer and the journalist, will explain their roles and what will happen during flight. A PIC briefing should cover, at a minimum: Who is fulfilling each role in flight operations. The expectations of each member of the flight crew. A general description of the operations area. The expected weather at the location. Any known hazards, including winds, obstacles, known high traffic areas, any nearby airports or expected air traffic. The specific mission goals, including expected shots, angles or subjects. Any known privacy or ethical issues and mitigation steps. 12.1.1.5 Pre-Trip Inspection Before leaving for the operations area, the PIC should conduct a pre-trip inspection of the UAS. A pre-trip inspection includes charging batteries, checking various mounting hardware, and checking the camera and storage media to ensure it is sufficient for the task. 12.1.2 Pre-Flight Pre-flight operations are done immediately before any flight work is to occur. The pre-flight checklist repeats some of the pre-trip checklist, such as inspecting the aircraft and some of the control surfaces. Pre-trip and pre-flight inspections help ensure airworthiness and will serve as an early warning for both maintenance issues and for mechanical issues that could substantially affect or cancel flight operations. The general rules of pre-flight are: The PIC touches the UAS. The PIC is responsible for the aircraft and all around them. Thus, the PIC will conduct the pre-flight inspection, connect the batteries, etc. When on site, operations personnel must delineate a takeoff and landing area of at least 10 feet x 10 feet and ensure it is free of debris. When on site, if non-operations people are around, operations personnel may be required to secure an area to be kept free of people so the UAS can operate without flying over people. That place may be the takeoff and landing zone. That space, to remain free of people, should be as large as the PIC thinks is practical. Weather can be very localized. When you arrive, you should check your location weather against the weather report you got from a flight briefing or automated observation service. Cloud ceilings will be most difficult to estimate on site, so be reasonable. If the clouds look low, stay low. Don’t fly if fog is present. Wind conditions also vary by location. An anemometer is a valuable tool for measuring wind on site, informing the PIC if wind speeds are within operational limits and how they may affect flight operations. Turn off WiFi connectivity on any UAS mounted devices, such as cameras. Active WiFi devices on the UAS can interfere with critical 2.4 GHz RC and video transmissions. Because most non-military UAS systems use 2.4GHz for either RC or video transmission, only enable WiFi if you are certain there will be no interference with your UAS hardware. Before takeoff, make sure your compass is not receiving interference from nearby metal objects, and that you have enough GPS satellite connections. 12.1.3 Flight The flight checklist isn’t really a checklist. It’s a Do Constantly list. It’s listed as a reminder. UAS operators must: Be constantly scanning for airborne traffic or obstacles. The observer must report them immediately. Be constantly scanning for people on the ground in the flight area. The observer must report them immediately. Be constantly checking battery levels and returning before reaching 25 percent of the remaining capacity. Be constantly checking flight parameters like altitude to ensure they remain within restrictions and operational goals. At battery changes, and at battery changes only, should the PIC, Observer and Journalist discuss changes to the operational plan. While the UAS is in flight, the PIC needs to focus on flying, and the observer needs to focus on hazards. 12.1.4 Post-Flight The post-flight checklist is broken into three parts: Shutting down the drone, which is done by the PIC; inspecting the aircraft; and filling out logs. Logging is an important part of aviation safety and will serve as an important document in maintenance of your UAS. 12.1.5 Logging UAS operations can be divided into three separate logs, largely transported over from manned aviation. They are a maintenance log, a battery log, and a flight log. Maintenance Log A maintenance log is a simple list of issues to be checked or fixed between flights. PICs should note any issue that should be checked, from an odd wobble, unusual sound, an unusually hot motor at landing, to a complete component failure. The log should include the date, UAS Make &amp; Model, UAS Registration Number, the ID number of the battery used when the issue occurred, the issue, who reported it, the date repaired, who repaired it and notes. Battery Log A battery log serves as a warning for when a battery is getting worn out and could fail. UAS batteries will degrade, providing progressively less flight time. Fully charged batteries that go unused and are not discharged for over a week can also lead to damaged battery cells. A battery log will highlight failing batteries, and give the PIC a guide as to how much time a battery will give in flight. A battery log should note the date, UAS make and model, UAS registration number, the number of past charges, the percentage of battery power remaining at shutdown, total flight time, battery depletion rate, any signs of puffing (an indicator that the battery is damaged), and usage conditions. For example, if you loaded a DJI Inspire with a 360 video camera rig containing six GoPros cameras, and flew it on a 100°F, you would make note of those operating conditions. Flight Log A flight log will highlight the important events that occur from the time a UAS takes off to the time it has landed and been powered down by the PIC. Each UAS will have it’s own log. It should note the date, the battery used during flight, and the total flight time. Each entry should also have space for important and relevant notes about the flight, which may include a mission overview, flying conditions, distance flown, take-off and landing locations, a hard landing, etc. "],
["ethics-and-privacy.html", "Chapter 13 Ethics and Privacy", " Chapter 13 Ethics and Privacy UAS enable individuals to remotely access spaces and vantage points that may, for many reasons, be otherwise out of reach. Avoid actions in the air that you yourself would not engage in on the ground. Consider referring to the SPJ Code of Ethics, especially the principles about minimizing harm, such as the ones seen below, which are relevant to UAS operations: “Balance the public’s need for information against potential harm or discomfort. Pursuit of the news is not a license for arrogance or undue intrusiveness.” While Part 107 prohibits flights over people it doesn’t stop you from flying near them laterally. Be mindful of bystanders and consider their perceptions of drones, and what you’re doing in the air with a UAS. Remember: They don’t know what you are going to do with a device that makes many uncomfortable. Don’t deliberately fly over private property if publicly accessible views are available. Don’t use a drone to antagonize. “Show compassion for those who may be affected by news coverage. Realize that private people have a greater right to control information about themselves than public figures and others who seek power, influence or attention. Weigh the consequences of publishing or broadcasting personal information. Avoid pandering to lurid curiosity, even if others do.” In short, respect people’s privacy, and don’t use a UAS as a tool for intrusion. Don’t fly up to people’s windows, and seek permission to fly over private property where practical. While there has been extensive speculation about how high above the ground private property extends, there is currently no clear legal precedent indicating where private property ends and public airspace, in the context of drones, begins. Until a legal standard is set, all due caution should be exercised. Also, consider referring to the National Press Photographers Association Code of Ethics, including the following standards: “Do not intentionally sabotage the efforts of other journalists.” When covering a news event along with other media organizations flying UASs, avoid using your UAS to obstruct or take down another UAS. Doing so could not only hurt bystanders and damage property, but also require a report to the FAA, jeopardizing your Part 107 certification. Media using UAS should coordinate with each other, just as manned helicopter pilots have done since the 1950s. “While photographing subjects do not intentionally contribute to, alter, or seek to alter or influence events.” UAS systems, especially multirotors, are loud. Consider how the noise generated by your UAS, and its presence, influences events, people, and animals. "],
