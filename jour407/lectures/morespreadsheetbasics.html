# Min, Max, Average, Median and Rank

class: middle

# Does anyone see the problem here?

- How confident were you that you could talk someone through everything you did?
- How about if the analysis got complicated? 
- Or if you needed to do substantial data cleaning or manipulation?

# The problem is Reliability, Replicability and Transparency

- Reliability: How sure are we that we got the right answer? That we've done everything correctly?
- Replicability: If we had to do it all again, would we get the same answer? If someone else did it, would they?
- Transparency: If our results are challenged, can we show exactly what we've done to defend it?
