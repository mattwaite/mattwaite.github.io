# Assignment

- Using tax data from the Nebraska Department of Revenue, calculate the following:
- The change in Federal Adjusted Gross Income between 2000 and 2013 for every county in Nebraska.
- The average the number of exemptions per return in 2000 and 2013 for every county in Nebraska.
- The change in average Nebraska Net Taxable Income per return between 2000 and 2013 for every county in Nebraska.
- In a paragraph, explain what you did. How did you arrive at the answers you got? What steps did you have to take? And answer this question: If you had to explain how you got those answers to an editor, how comfortable are you that you could do that, and that you'd get the same answers?
