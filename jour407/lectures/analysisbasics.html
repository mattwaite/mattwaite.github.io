- Numeric change vs percent change
- Repeat after me: New - Old / Old
- Orders of operations: PEMDAS. 
- So repeat after me: (New - Old) / Old.

# Calculate rates

- Rates: Make big numbers comprehensible and disparate things comparable
- Choose a base.
- (Number/Total) = Proportion
- Proportion x Z where Z is the number of people you want to calculate the rate for. 1,000? 100,000?
