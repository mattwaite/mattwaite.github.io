<p>Very few students of media these days read a printed newspaper, but they were enormously important in the foundations of the country and in what we know as media today. Thomas Jefferson, famously, wrote that if presented with a choice between government and no newspapers and newspapers but no government, he’d choose newspapers.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The people are the only censors of their governors: and even their errors will tend to keep these to the true principles of their institution. To punish these errors too severely would be to suppress the only safeguard of the public liberty. The way to prevent these irregular interpositions of the people is to give them full information of their affairs thro’ the channel of the public papers, &amp; to contrive that those papers should penetrate the whole mass of the people. The basis of our governments being the opinion of the people, the very first object should be to keep that right; and were it left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers or newspapers without a government, I should not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter. But I should mean that every man should receive those papers &amp; be capable of reading them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Newspapers – or more specifically what they have evolved into now – form the backbone of the reported factual information we get through media. There are still, even now, more reporters working in written media than any other. Most of the reported information you see people talking about – facts around major news events – were first reported by people who work for what used to be newspaper companies.</p>

<p>Now that you’ve read a little of the history of newspapers, let’s focus in on a period of time around the late 1800s and early 1900s. Prior to this time, the daily newspapers in a city were funded by the political parties and were nakedly partisan. If you were this party, you read this paper, and the circulation of your paper depended on the size of the party. The papers had no issue at all accepting patronage from the parties – when the party was in power, the paper would get government printing contracts. It was in the late 1800s that you had the rise of the Penny Press, where newspapers learned they could make more money selling to <em>everyone</em> instead of just one party. They shoved the nakedly partisan stuff to the editorial pages and put the news on the front page. Around that same time, you had the rise of Yellow Journalism, where newspaper publishers realized they could make <em>even more</em> money by sensationalizing the news – playing up the lurid and titillating aspects to get people to buy it. More readers meant more ad dollars and that meant more profit.</p>
<p>Around this same time – at the turn of the century – Adolf Ochs, publisher of the New York Times, tried a new strategy, Instead of sensationalizing the news with the other yellow journalism papers, he and his Times would professionalize the news. They would begin hiring educated men (and later women) – people with a college education, which was far less common than it is now – as editors and reporters to build a news product based on accuracy and the idea that an informed democracy was a healthy democracy.</p>
<p>Slowly, other papers began to join this professionalization movement. According to the history of the American Society of Newspaper Editors, 10 editors from midwestern papers met in 1912 on a trip to Montana and started talking about what became the ASNE. The organization formally began in 1922, electing officers and more importantly drafting a code of ethics.</p>
<p>That code of ethics would form the backbone of professional journalism ethics to this day. The Society of Professional Journalists would, in their words, borrow it in 1926, wrote their own in 1976 and revised it in 1984, 1987, 1996 and 2014.</p>
<p>The main points of the current SPJ Code of Ethics are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Seek Truth and Report It: Ethical journalism should be accurate and fair. Journalists should be honest and courageous in gathering, reporting and interpreting information.</p></li>
<li><p>Minimize Harm: Ethical journalism treats sources, subjects, colleagues and members of the public as human beings deserving of respect.</p></li>
<li><p>Act Independently: The highest and primary obligation of ethical journalism is to serve the public.</p></li>
<li><p>Be Accountable and Transparent: Ethical journalism means taking responsibility for one’s work and explaining one’s decisions to the public. (<span class="citation" data-cites="spj_2014">Spj (<a href="references.html#ref-spj_2014" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span>)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Does every news organization achieve these high minded principles every day? Of course not. Some not ever. But few, if any, other professions have these kinds of ethical principles publicly stated and adhered to.</p>

<h2 data-number="2.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-death-of-newspapers"><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> The death of newspapers</h2>
<p>Newspapers have been killed off more times than a horror movie villain who keeps coming back in a half-dozen sequels. The first invention to kill newspapers was radio. Then television was to do in both radio and newspapers. The internet has killed newspapers at least a half dozen times since the rise of the commercial internet in 2006.</p>
<p>A consistent theme of this class – which you will hear about here first - is this: Technology does not kill off a form of media. It does, however, force that form of media to evolve.</p>
<p>Among the most comprehensive views of media in the United States is the Pew Research Center’s State of the News Media report. They maintain a wide array of datasets about various forms of media over time and we will spend a great deal of time with them in this course.</p>
<p>If all you looked at was print circulation, then yes, newspapers are clearly in trouble. Weekday circulation of all newspapers in the US is now 24.3 million on the average weekday (<span class="citation" data-cites="pew_newspapers_2022"><span>“Newspapers Fact Sheet”</span> (<a href="references.html#ref-pew_newspapers_2022" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span>). That’s the lowest point since the data was tracked starting in 1940, when weekday circulation was 41 million.</p>
<p>But let’s put that another way. In 1940, there were 132 million Americans. That means in 1940, 31 percent of the total population – from babies to elderly people - got a newspaper during the week. But total population isn’t a great metric here. How about households? According to the Census, there were 35 million households in the US. That means not only did most households get a paper, millions of them got <em>more than one</em>.</p>
<p>By 2020, there’s 126.8 million households. That means less than 20 percent of households got a newspaper during the week. And it’s been declining every year since 1988. Peak newspaper circulation happened in 1973, and while the number of newspapers remained relatively stable until the late 80s, it was not keeping up with population growth.</p>

<p>Now, while that is bad, for decades it didn’t seem to matter in terms of newspaper revenues. Circulation had been flat or declining since the 1970s, and started declining every year in 1988, but newspaper revenues from advertising, the main source of income for newspapers since the Penny Press days, peaked in 2005, and has fallen off a cliff since.</p>
<p>Sometime in 2019 or 2020, the industry as a whole crossed an inflection point: More revenue now comes from circulation revenue – now meaning digital subscriptions – than advertising. Newspapers are now entering a new phase not seen since the Penny Press – the business model is based on keeping subscribers happy, not advertisers.</p>
<iframe src="https://www.pewresearch.org/journalism/chart/sotnm-newspapers-newspaper-industry-estimated-advertising-and-circulation-revenue/iframe/" id="pew62609" scrolling="no" width="100%" height="500px" frameborder="0">

<p>All of this disruption has had a profound impact on the number of jobs in newspapers.</p>
<p>Newsrooms – where the news product is made – employ reporters and photographers as the people who go out and gather the news. They report to editors, who assign stories, edit them and figure out what the most important news of the day is to guide decisions on what to emphasize. In the old days, that meant laying out the front page and the various sections. What was the biggest news of the day? That got the biggest headline on the front page. Now, editors have a variety of emphasis points, from the website, to mobile apps to push notifications, email newsletters and social media channels.</p>
<p>The free-fall of advertising dollars in newspapers has meant a similar free fall in newsroom employment. According to Pew’s data, newsroom employment since 2004 peaked in 2006, right before the real estate bubble popped dragging the global economy down with it. In 2006, more than 74,410 people worked in newsrooms in the US. By 2020, it was 30,800.</p>

<p>For most of the history of the US, newspapers have been a for-profit business. The size and quality of the paper has been dependent on the business that fueled it through the twin sources of revenues – advertising and circulation. And for more than a century, advertising dollars were print advertising dollars.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, that story remains largely the same, even though newspapers have been chasing digital ad dollars since the late 1990s. According to Pew, digital ads make up only 40 percent of newspapers advertising revenues.</p>
<iframe src="https://www.pewresearch.org/journalism/chart/sotnm-newspapers-percentage-of-newspaper-advertising-revenue-coming-from-digital/iframe/" id="pew62611" scrolling="no" width="100%" height="500px" frameborder="0">

<p>That share should continue to grow, as audiences for newspapers online continues to grow.</p>

<p>But a growing number of news organizations are adopting a not-for-profit model. The first major news organization to be a non-profit was The Associated Press, which was founded as a non-profit. A few other non-profit journalism organizations – most notably the Center for Public Integrity in 1989 – had been around but it was not commonplace.</p>
<p>In 2007, the news world changed with the founding of ProPublica, funded by a multi-million gift from the Sandler Foundation – to the tune of $10 million per year. ProPublica is a non-profit entity. They publish stories on their website, but their main channel for publication has been distributing stories to news partners – other news organizations. The organization has since won six Pulitzer Prizes.</p>
<p>Since ProPublica’s founding, hundreds of non-profit entities have spring up. The Institute for Nonprofit News claims there are more than 400 independent news organizations.</p>
<p>In Nebraska, two events since 2020 have altered the journalism landscape in the state significantly.</p>
<p>The first event was Warren Buffett selling the Omaha World-Herald and 30 other newspapers owned by Berkshire Hathaway to Lee Enterprises, which until then had owned the Lincoln Journal-Star, the Columbus Telegram and the Fremont Tribune, among others. After the sale, every daily newspaper in the state save two – the Norfolk Daily News and the McCook Gazette – would be owned by Lee Enterprises.</p>
<p>Then, in 2021, two non-profit newsrooms formed in the state: <a href="https://flatwaterfreepress.org/">The Flatwater Free Press</a> and the <a href="https://nebraskaexaminer.com/">Nebraska Examiner</a>. Both were started by former World-Herald journalists. The Flatwater Free Press has been focused more on statewide issues, investigative reporting and the ProPublica model of distribution. The Examiner is more focused on politics and state government coverage.</p>
